       "   'summary': 'AT&T CFO Pascal Desroches Updates Shareholders. DALLAS, September 15, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pascal Desroches, senior executive vice president and chief financial officer of AT&T Inc.* (NYSE:T), spoke today at the Bank of America Media, Communications & Entertainment Conference, where he provided an update to shareholders. AT&T also continues to experience healthy demand for HBO Max in both domestic and international markets. The company recently announced its plans to expand into six European countries next month with plans to launch in at least 14 additional territories in Europe in 2022. As previously indicated, AT&T expects most of the subscriber growth in the second half of the year to come from outside the United States due to the strategic decision to cease offering HBO Max as a subscription on Amazon Channels. The company anticipates this decision will likely impact total HBO Max / HBO domestic subscribers and net additions in the third quarter. However, Desroches reiterated that AT&T’s guidance for 70 million to 73 million global HBO Max and HBO subscribers by the end of 2021 factors in the impact of this decision.3'}]}"

The company anticipates this decision will likely impact total HBO Max / HBO domestic subscribers and net additions in the third quarter. However, Desroches reiterated that AT&T’s guidance for 70 million to 73 million global HBO Max and HBO subscribers by the end of 2021 factors in the impact of this decision.3'},\n",
