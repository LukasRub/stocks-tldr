AT&T CFO Pascal Desroches Updates Shareholders [CLS] [SEP] DALLAS, September 15, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pascal Desroches, senior executive vice president and chief financial officer of AT&T Inc.* (NYSE:T), spoke today at the Bank of America Media, Communications & Entertainment Conference, where he provided an update to shareholders. [CLS] [SEP] Desroches said that AT&T continues to successfully execute in its market focus areas of 5G, fiber and HBO Max. While acknowledging the wireless industry continues to benefit from a healthy-demand backdrop, AT&T remains steadfast in its commitment to growing its postpaid phone base profitably. Desroches said AT&T’s strength in wireless has been supported by the company’s outstanding network quality, which has improved measurably over the last several years. AT&T has the Nation’s Best 5G Network1 and, for the fourth straight year, America’s Best Wireless Network2 overall. In addition, as most recently indicated by AT&T’s second-quarter 2021 results, its revamped go-to-market strategy has enabled the company to both reduce churn and improve industry flow share, yielding materially better postpaid phone subscriber net adds versus those experienced over the last several years. [CLS] [SEP] With respect to its fiber initiatives, Desroches indicated that the company remains confident in its ability to achieve its adjusted end-of-year incremental customer locations passed target in the 2.5 million range. As previously noted, AT&T has experienced some disruption in its supply chain. However, at this juncture the company believes the issue has been addressed and remains comfortable in its ability to achieve its long-term guidance for 30 million locations by the end of 2025. [CLS] [SEP] AT&T also continues to experience healthy demand for HBO Max in both domestic and international markets. The company recently announced its plans to expand into six European countries next month with plans to launch in at least 14 additional territories in Europe in 2022. As previously indicated, AT&T expects most of the subscriber growth in the second half of the year to come from outside the United States due to the strategic decision to cease offering HBO Max as a subscription on Amazon Channels. The company anticipates this decision will likely impact total HBO Max / HBO domestic subscribers and net additions in the third quarter. However, Desroches reiterated that AT&T’s guidance for 70 million to 73 million global HBO Max and HBO subscribers by the end of 2021 factors in the impact of this decision.3 [CLS] [SEP] AT&T continues to anticipate that its pending WarnerMedia-Discovery transaction will close by mid-2022. After close of that transaction and on a pro-forma basis, AT&T expects annual revenues to grow at a low single digits CAGR4 from 2022 to 2024 with annual adjusted EBITDA5 and adjusted EPS6 growing at a CAGR in the mid-single digit range. After close and subject to AT&T Board approval, the company anticipates annual dividends paid of $8 billion to $9 billion, reflecting a payout ratio of 40% to 43% on projected free cash flow of $20 billion plus in 2023.7 [CLS] [SEP] 1 AT&T awarded Best 5G Network by GWS OneScore 2021.

[CLS] [SEP] 4 Compound annual growth rate. [CLS] [SEP] 5 EBITDA is operating income before depreciation and amortization. [CLS] [SEP] 6 AT&T expects adjustments to 2021-2024 reported diluted EPS to include merger-related amortization ($4.3 billion for 2021 and approximately $1 billion per quarter in 2022 until closing of the WarnerMedia transaction), adjusted equity income, non-cash mark-to-market benefit plan gains/losses, and other items. The company expects the mark-to-market adjustments, which are driven by interest rates and investment returns that are not reasonably estimable at this time, to be a significant item. AT&T’s 2021 EPS depends on future levels of revenues and expenses and performance of our equity investment in DIRECTV which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the reported GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. [CLS] [SEP] 7 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that is frequently used by investors and credit rating agencies to provide relevant and useful information. Free cash flow is cash from operating activities minus capital expenditures, and AT&T will include cash distributions received from DIRECTV, including those reported as investing activities, as part of Free Cash Flow. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities and capital expenditures, the company is not able to provide a reconciliation between projected free cash flow and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort.

Ford to build $11.4 billion mega campuses for electric car production [CLS] [SEP] Saying Ford is driving head on into a future of electric vehicles may be an understatement. Think more along the line of hauling a-–. [CLS] [SEP] The Detroit-based auto giant said Monday it will partner with SK Innovation to invest $11.4 billion to construct two "mega-sites" — one in Tennessee and the other in Kentucky — that will build electric trucks and batteries. Ford's portion of the investment — $7 billion — is the largest manufacturing investment in the company's 118-year-old history. [CLS] [SEP] “This is a transformative moment where Ford will lead America’s transition to electric vehicles and usher in a new era of clean, carbon-neutral manufacturing,” said Ford executive chairman Bill Ford, a long-time proponent of the push to electric vehicles. “With this investment and a spirit of innovation, we can achieve goals once thought mutually exclusive – protect our planet, build great electric vehicles Americans will love and contribute to our nation’s prosperity.” [CLS] [SEP] Stanton, Tennessee will see the construction of Blue Oval City, which Ford says will aid in building an "expanded" electric-truck lineup. Currently, Ford has released the all-electric SUV called the Mach-E and soon will begin producing the all-electric F-150 Lightning. The 3,600-acre campus will cover nearly 6 square miles, at a total of $5.6 billion. It's expected to created 6,000 jobs. [CLS] [SEP] An all-new $5.6 billion mega campus in Stanton, Tenn., called Blue Oval City, will create approximately 6,000 new jobs and reimagine how vehicles and batteries are manufactured.

[CLS] [SEP] No less impressive is the other mega campus slated to open in Glendale, Kentucky. Dubbed BlueOvalSK Battery Park, it will be a dedicated battery manufacturing complex for Ford's expanding roster of electric vehicles. The 1,500-acre site will cost $5.8 billion to build and create 5,000 jobs. The location is targeted to open in 2025. [CLS] [SEP] “This is our moment — our biggest investment ever — to help build a better future for America,” said Ford CEO Jim Farley. “We are moving now to deliver breakthrough electric vehicles for the many rather than the few. It’s about creating good jobs that support American families, an ultra-efficient, carbon-neutral manufacturing system, and a growing business that delivers value for communities, dealers and shareholders.” [CLS] [SEP] The campuses are part of Ford's $30 billion investment in electric vehicles through 2025. Ford expects 40% to 50% of its global vehicle volume to be fully electric by 2030. [CLS] [SEP] Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

NIO: Consumers Will Soon Realize NIO Has What Other EVs Are Missing, BaaS [CLS] [SEP] Summary [CLS] [SEP] NIO is a leading player in the Chinese electric vehicle market and their unique technology grants it several long-term advantages over competitors. [CLS] [SEP] Their battery as a service technology solves a lot of short and long-term problems with EVs and cars in general. [CLS] [SEP] China has been on a legislative tear recently, hurting many domestic companies. However, NIO's mission lines up with many Chinese goals and is likely to enjoy preferential treatment. [CLS] [SEP] The current fall of Chinese stocks makes NIO an attractive long-term investment. [CLS] [SEP] NIO logo and the Nio"s user center, NIO House [CLS] [SEP] Andy Feng/iStock Editorial via Getty Images [CLS] [SEP] Thesis [CLS] [SEP] NIO Inc. (NIO) is one of the leading electric vehicle producers in China, the largest market for EVs. While still being outsold by Tesla (TSLA), the fast-growing nature of the company and market offers promise. Their battery as a service subscription option offers NIO a unique advantage and solves many of the problems consumers have with EVs. The stock has seen some weakness over the past three months, mainly because of China's massive regulatory crackdown. NIO, however, will likely see preferential treatment as the goals of the company align with that of the Chinese Communist Party. [CLS] [SEP] NIO's current position [CLS] [SEP] To understand NIO's position in the Chinese EV market, we first need to understand the Chinese EV market. [CLS] [SEP] First off, ICE vehicles are still dominant in China, but the market for EVs seems to be in the early stages of exponential growth and is expected to continue to grow rapidly, with EVs expected to make up ~34% of total Chinese car sales in 2025. [CLS] [SEP] China car sales [CLS] [SEP] Source: Business Insider [CLS] [SEP] Being an early leader and domestic producer of EVs should position NIO well for this type of growth. [CLS] [SEP] The Chinese electric vehicle market is pretty fragmented, but Tesla has a solid lead. Chinese companies BYD (OTCPK:BYDDY), NIO, XPeng (XPEV), and Li Auto (LI) are also relevant. In 2020, Tesla sold ~135k vehicles in China, while BYD shipped 130k units, NIO shipped 44k units, XPeng shipped 27k units, and Li shipped 15k. [CLS] [SEP] It is worth noting that these figures will likely be quite different for the full year 2021. The market is growing and changing rapidly, and new EVs like the Wuling Hong Guang MINI EV made by SAIC-GM-Wuling, a sub $5,000 car with a top speed of 62 mph, are flying off the shelves. [CLS] [SEP] NIO's advantage [CLS] [SEP] I firmly believe that NIO's battery as a service and battery swap offerings will benefit NIO in the long run. This is rooted in the belief that efficient battery swapping can solve or alleviate many of the pain points that consumers have with EVs, but consumers have not realized that yet. [CLS] [SEP] Battery swap program [CLS] [SEP] Nio battery swap [CLS] [SEP] Source: Electrek [CLS] [SEP] NIO offers drivers a monthly subscription to drivers that grants them access to their 484 swap stations. NIO claims to have completed over 2 million swaps. This unique approach, previously abandoned by Tesla after a poor performance in 2015, offers more advantages to their consumers than immediately apparent. Battery as a service (BaaS) solves or alleviates a lot of problems that all EVs have. [CLS] [SEP] The problems [CLS] [SEP] EVs have a lot of advantages over gasoline-powered cars, as I am sure your friendly neighborhood Tesla owner has informed you of. They boast instant torque and quiet performance, neither of which can be said about their ICE counterparts. That being said, if EVs were unilaterally better than gasoline-powered cars, they would have seen much higher adoption by this point in time. It is clear the market still sees some problems with EVs, and I think BaaS can help. [CLS] [SEP] Some of the problems include: [CLS] [SEP] High upfront cost. Despite the promised savings on fuel and maintenance throughout ownership, some people are turned off by the higher upfront cost of owning an electric vehicle. For example, the NIO ES6, their basic SUV, costs the equivalent of $52,000. On the other hand, the Haval H6, the 2020 best-selling SUV in China, starts at just over $17,000. [CLS] [SEP] Range anxiety. While the NIO's ES6 already has a stellar range of 380 miles, range anxiety is often cited as one of the main concerns people have when considering buying an electric vehicle. [CLS] [SEP] Long charge times. Charging NIO's 100 kWh battery from empty using their charge station will take 5 hours with a 20 kW system and 14 hours with a 7kW system. [CLS] [SEP] Battery degradation. This problem is highly noticeable in phones. A phone that was once able to last an entire day may not be able to make it through lunch without losing 20% a year later. Logically, people wonder if they will have the same problem with the batteries in their car. According to a recent survey, 46% of consumers believe that their battery will last 65k miles or less. [CLS] [SEP] High cost of battery replacement. This is one that is more assumed and has less hard data to back it up. I am sure engine replacements in case of engine failure in ICE cars cost quite a bit as well. That being said, the idea of battery failure resulting in a replacement fee of upwards of $10,000 is certainly not a draw to EVs. [CLS] [SEP] A belief that the battery will give out under 65k miles is largely unfounded. However, while EVs have measures to keep battery degradation from happening, it does happen. [CLS] [SEP] Here are the results of a UK study of 1,016 EVs purchased from 2014-2019 and the percent of the original range they had. [CLS] [SEP] Source: which.co.uk [CLS] [SEP] There is a noticeable and exponential pattern of battery decay over time. While it appears this is not a major concern among people who own EVs or even potential owners, this certainly is not a draw. [CLS] [SEP] In general, most of the sore spots consumers have with EVs are related to the battery. Whether it long charge times, degradation, high costs, etc., electric vehicles have a lot of problems to overcome before they see large-scale adoption. [CLS] [SEP] How battery swap can help [CLS] [SEP] Those issues above cover a large range of issues preventing people from switching to an electric vehicle. Below are the ways that BaaS can alleviate or solve them. [CLS] [SEP] For the higher upfront cost, NIO has leveraged their BaaS to save consumers money at the point of purchase. If the consumer agrees to sign up for the BaaS subscription program, which costs ~USD 142 per month and grants them six swaps per month, they enjoy USD 10,000 off the vehicle's purchase price. While this does not yet put NIO in the price range of their gasoline-powered competitors, it is a step in the right direction and will likely yield better results as the price of batteries continues to come down. [CLS] [SEP] Long charge times seem to be the main reason BaaS was implemented in the first place. It appears that a lot of consumers enjoy knowing that, nearly anywhere, they can stop for fuel, and within 5 minutes, have a full tank of gas and are ready to get back onto the road. With EVs, this is not the case. Even with Tesla's V3 superchargers, to go from 0-100% takes 63.5 minutes. At a NIO power swap station, a total battery replacement can take place in just three minutes, giving the driver a fresh battery with a full charge. This is about the same amount of time spent refueling a car, and it is arguably more passive as there is no need to get out and pump gas. As a cherry on top, automatic battery and electric system checks are completed to ensure that the battery and car are in top shape. [CLS] [SEP] Battery degradation is also aided by battery swap. Unfortunately, there is not much research on battery degradation and how it affects consumer decisions, but I thought smartphones would be an interesting parallel to draw. [CLS] [SEP] Smartphone poll [CLS] [SEP] Source: Statista [CLS] [SEP] Smartphones are nearly ubiquitous, and it is evident to anyone who has had a phone for more than a year that, over time, the battery begins to hold less charge. In fact, it is the second most popular reason why people choose to buy new phones, ranked even higher than wanting a newer model. [CLS] [SEP] Phones are one of, if not people's most extensive interaction with a lithium-ion battery. People tend to upgrade their phones every two years. If, after two years, people are noticing such a massive reduction in battery life that they are forced to upgrade, they may be turned away from a battery-powered car. [CLS] [SEP] The option to swap out a degraded battery for a fresh one in minutes at no extra charge would fix this problem. [CLS] [SEP] The argument that BaaS helps with range anxiety is less clear than the arguments listed above; however, I think it is compelling. Here is a graph showing the range of electric vehicles over time. [CLS] [SEP] EV range in 2020 [CLS] [SEP] Source: insideevs [CLS] [SEP] While some of this is due to an increase in the efficiency in cars, the steady linear growth in the range is primarily due to increases in battery capacity. Here is an excerpt from an inside EVs article that shows their progression. [CLS] [SEP] NIO first started with a 70 kWh battery in 2018, then introduced 84 kWh in 2019 and most recently 100 kWh versions in late 2020. [CLS] [SEP] As you can see, EVs went from a median range on a full charge of about 70 miles to over 270 miles, a nearly 4x increase in range over just nine years. [CLS] [SEP] NIO knows that they will continue to improve their battery capacity over time and that consumers are still looking for more range out of their cars. For that reason, all of their cars are designed to be able to fit any future batteries in them. [CLS] [SEP] A perfect, and exciting, example of this was announced recently. NIO is launching a 150 kWh battery in 2022. [CLS] [SEP] This is supposed to be included in their ET7 model, but, this is where BaaS gets really cool. [CLS] [SEP] Here is a quote from this Inside EVs article recapping the announcement. [CLS] [SEP] All NIO users can opt to upgrade to 150 kWh battery. The first-generation 2018 NIO ES8 with a new 150 kWh will be able to get an NEDC range of more than 730 km (454 miles). [CLS] [SEP] To put that into perspective, at launch, the 2018 NIO ES8 had a comparatively poor 220-mile range. Going to a swapping station after the rollout of this battery would result in a more than doubling of the range the car had when you bought it, ~4 years ago. [CLS] [SEP] From a consumer perspective, compare doubling capacity to a 10% (and exponentially growing) reduction in battery capacity over a similar time period. [CLS] [SEP] Quick overview of China [CLS] [SEP] This article is getting long, but I feel the need to briefly go over my opinion on how NIO will be affected by the current situations in China. NIO is headquartered in Shanghai, so not addressing China would be to ignore the elephant in the room. [CLS] [SEP] What is happening there? [CLS] [SEP] China has recently been on an absolute legislative tear. They have cracked down on rideshare companies, video game companies, and the steel industry, to name a few. These aggressive and seemingly unending policies have sent Chinese stocks, including NIO, down significantly from highs. Here is a chart of the Chinese version of the S&P 500, down more than 30% from 52-week highs. [CLS] [SEP] GXC chart [CLS] [SEP] Source: Google Finance [CLS] [SEP] Why NIO should be fine [CLS] [SEP] I recently wrote an article on Rio Tinto (RIO), an iron ore supplier to China's massive steel production industry. In the research for that article, I learned that China's crackdown on steel was mainly in pursuit of its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by the year 2060. Electric vehicles would be in line with this goal. [CLS] [SEP] Secondly, take a look at some of these policies I found in an article written by Columbia University. These are paraphrased, but the spirit of these laws remains the same. [CLS] [SEP] In 2019, each Chinese vehicle manufacturer and importer was required to make or import at least 10% electric vehicles. The percentage increased to 12% in 2020. [CLS] [SEP] The Chinese government provides subsidies to manufacturers of electric vehicles. All electric or hybrid cars are eligible for subsidies between USD 1,500 and USD 3,600, depending on the type and range of the vehicle. [CLS] [SEP] The Chinese government exempts electric vehicles from consumption and sales taxes, saving purchasers tens of thousands of RMB (equivalent to thousands of dollars). It also waives 50% of vehicle registration fees for electric vehicles. [CLS] [SEP] The Chinese government also uses its procurement power to promote electric vehicles. A May 2016 order requires that half of the new vehicles purchased by China's central government be new energy vehicles within five years. [CLS] [SEP] The Chinese central government promotes the development of EV charging infrastructure as a matter of national policy. It sets targets (120,000 EV charging stations and 4.8 million EV charging posts by 2020), provides funding, and mandates standards. [CLS] [SEP] All of these policies show strong support for electric vehicles, but what about NIO in general. Well, the Chinese government seems fond of them, and in early 2020, several state-owned groups issued NIO a $1 billion "investment" (widely considered a bailout.) [CLS] [SEP] While there is not much evidence for China preferring NIO over Tesla yet, it would make sense for China to pick a domestic company to dominate their auto market. [CLS] [SEP] The only way I see China's involvement in NIO hurting, instead of helping, US investors is if they crackdown on the stock market as a whole. If China decided to run NIO, or take it private, and use its power to void the VEI contracts that US investors hold, that would obviously be bad for investors. [CLS] [SEP] However, even for China, this would be a hostile move that would arguably hurt their economy as they lose the ability to easily access capital injection from overseas. [CLS] [SEP] Brief assessment of Evergrande crisis [CLS] [SEP] Right now, the situation is still developing, and it is unclear how it will play out. But basically, there are three potential outcomes of this crisis. [CLS] [SEP] Situation one, nothing bad happens. If that is the case, perfect, you should take advantage of the discount from all-time highs (which isn't entirely due to Evergrande) and buy-in. [CLS] [SEP] Situation two, something sort of bad happens. In this case, NIO will almost certainly see some hit or another in share price. It is already pretty low and has bounced off the ~$30 level in the past, but anything is possible in the short term. If this is the case, and NIO does fall, I recommend buying in at even lower prices. [CLS] [SEP] Situation three, something really bad happens. If something really bad happens and all of China is affected, then the auto industry would almost certainly enter a period of low sales. This would hurt NIO as a company, as they are currently in a rapid growth mode that depends on recurring revenue to continue investments in themselves. In this case, a re-evaluation would be necessary to determine if NIO will be able to survive and thrive post-crisis. [CLS] [SEP] Conclusion [CLS] [SEP] NIO has a technology that offers a solution to many of the problems that EVs face, and it seems a large portion of consumers have yet to realize that. BaaS either alleviates or solves the problems of high upfront cost, long charging times, range anxiety, battery degradation, and obsolescence. They also are the leader, by a long shot, in BaaS and the infrastructure needed to support it. So, if consumers do take a liking to it, it would take a long time for competitors to catch up. Even if the situations in China push the stock price down, I will continue holding, and potentially buy more NIO shares and sell covered calls. I would recommend other EV bulls do the same. China seems unwilling to let NIO fail, and unless the CCP reverses its climate stance or takes total control over NIO, US investors should stand to profit.
EV Competition Has Arrived: Does Tesla Have The Answer? [CLS] [SEP] Summary [CLS] [SEP] Tesla set the standard when it comes to electric vehicles. [CLS] [SEP] Now, Tesla is starting to face competition as legacy automakers and startups like Lucid Motors are bringing their electric vehicles to market. [CLS] [SEP] Tesla trades at a high 20x P/S and is overvalued. [CLS] [SEP] Tesla is taking the best approach when it comes to developing AI thanks to the significant amount of data it's collecting. [CLS] [SEP] I'm neutral on Tesla. [CLS] [SEP] This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing community, Beating the Market. Learn More » [CLS] [SEP] Elon Musk Visits Germany [CLS] [SEP] Maja Hitij/Getty Images News [CLS] [SEP] Investment Thesis [CLS] [SEP] When Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) IPOd in 2010, EV cars weren’t as popular as they are today, and Tesla, with a visionary leader in Elon Musk, became the global EV giant that’s set the standard for high-quality EVS. However, Tesla’s stock price is up 700% over the past 18 months and it’s no longer a speculative play like it was a few years ago. Now that the EV market is heating up, Tesla faces more competition than it ever has, and its current valuation, Tesla is undoubtedly expensive, trading 325x price to FCF. [CLS] [SEP] Tesla is facing competition on multiple fronts, whether that be EV competitors in China or the legacy automakers such Ford (NYSE:F), Toyota (NYSE:TM), and Audi (OTCPK:AUDVF). In this article, I will highlight Tesla's competition and the threat to lose EV market share, specifically in China, which has a large, growing EV market. Other younger EV companies such as Lucid Motors (NASDAQ:LCID) and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) are improving products vehicles and offer viable EV cars with autonomous driving features. [CLS] [SEP] Tesla PS ratio [CLS] [SEP] Source: Ycharts.com [CLS] [SEP] Tesla is trading at 20x price to sales, which is significantly higher than it was two years ago when it was trading at 1.5x. Considering Tesla’s main revenue stream is a lower-margin business compared to that of a software company, a 20x P/S is extremely high. Considering that its valuation has run up and the competition is increasing, I label Tesla as a hold. [CLS] [SEP] Introduction [CLS] [SEP] Tesla faces many challenges ahead, but Tesla currently is the No. 1 EV company for a reason. Here’s a summary for what I will cover in this article and how Tesla will evolve its offerings, taking advantage of the massive amounts of data its cars collect. Tesla’s real value will come from the data it's collecting to create superior AI to understand how people drive and provide them with better services. [CLS] [SEP] First, I’ll provide analysis of the increasingly competitive EV landscape, highlighting the growing market when it comes to EV startups and legacy automakers reverting away from gas powered vehicles [CLS] [SEP] Then analyze the situation in China, exploring how Tesla had a favorable start entering this region, but since COVID it’s dealt with problems with its cars in China and it could face political risks as China would rather endorse local EV companies. [CLS] [SEP] How will Tesla respond? By continuing to innovate. [CLS] [SEP] Tesla’s AI gets stronger over time as its software processes more data, so the more data that its fleet collects, the more its AI has to interpret and analyze. [CLS] [SEP] Tesla will use this data to empower its AI software for autonomous driving and further expanding vertically to insurance products. [CLS] [SEP] Now let's explore the increasingly-competitive landscape. [CLS] [SEP] Legacy Competition [CLS] [SEP] In 2019, there were more than 91 million vehicles sold and 1% of them were EVs. EV sales are expected to rise from 3 million in 2020 to 66 million by 2040 and make up two-thirds of total car sales. The days of the internal combustion engine are numbered as more countries are banning the sale of ICE vehicles. President Biden recently set the goal for 50% of U.S. car sales to be electric by 2030 while the UK announced it's banning the sale of ICE vehicles starting 2030, and with California imposing the ban by 2035. [CLS] [SEP] Electric Vehicles Legacy Competition [CLS] [SEP] Source: www.bloomberg.com [CLS] [SEP] As illustrated above, the EV market is about to see exponential growth and legacy automakers such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF) have announced plans to only sell electric vehicles by 2035. Tesla has a first-mover advantage and created the standard when it comes to driving an EV as your everyday car, but the competition is starting to pile up. [CLS] [SEP] Tesla Models [CLS] [SEP] Source: Tesla [CLS] [SEP] Here are the current Tesla models that can be used to compare to the legacy automakers' EVs. [CLS] [SEP] Car Manufacturer [CLS] [SEP] Model [CLS] [SEP] Specs [CLS] [SEP] Ford [CLS] [SEP] - Mustang Mach E [CLS] [SEP] - F-150 Lightning [CLS] [SEP] - Crossover SUV that starts at $42,895, battery ranges span is 230-305 miles, 0-60 MPH in 3.8-5.2 seconds [CLS] [SEP] - The electric F-150 is supposed to arrive in the spring of 2022 [CLS] [SEP] - Offers Ford Co-Pilot 360 for autonomous driving [CLS] [SEP] VW [CLS] [SEP] ID.4 [CLS] [SEP] - Starts at $39,995, 260 miles range, 0-60 MPH 5.7 seconds [CLS] [SEP] - An SUV crossover that offers a simple design [CLS] [SEP] Nissan [CLS] [SEP] Leaf [CLS] [SEP] - Starts at $27,400, 226 miles range, 0-60 MPH 7.4 seconds [CLS] [SEP] Kia [CLS] [SEP] EV6 (2022) [CLS] [SEP] - Range of 300 miles, 0-60 MPH 5.2 seconds [CLS] [SEP] - Charges up to 210 miles in 18 minutes [CLS] [SEP] Audi [CLS] [SEP] Etron [CLS] [SEP] - SUV and Sportback versions, starts at $65,000, range 241 miles, 0-60 MPH in 5.1 seconds [CLS] [SEP] - The top of the line version, the Etron RS goes for $140,000 and goes from 0-60 mph in 3.1 seconds [CLS] [SEP] Porsche [CLS] [SEP] Taycan Turbo [CLS] [SEP] - Range from 212-275 miles, starts at $150,000, 0-60 MPH in 3 seconds [CLS] [SEP] Jaguar [CLS] [SEP] i-Pace [CLS] [SEP] - Starts at $69,900, 234-mile range, 0-60 MPH in 4.5 seconds [CLS] [SEP] BMW [CLS] [SEP] i4 [CLS] [SEP] - Starts at $45,000, range 367 miles, 0-60 MPH in 5.5 seconds [CLS] [SEP] - The premium goes from 0-60 MPH in 3.7 seconds [CLS] [SEP] More legacy car companies such as Mercedes and Lexus also have announced plans to enter the EV market. Given the new EVs set to hit the market, consumers now have options when choosing a luxurious or compact EV. Autonomous driving features are now a standard in these vehicles as well. Now, competitors are starting to enter the EV market and directly compete with Tesla. Consumers now have a lot of options to choose from when they go to buy an EV. [CLS] [SEP] New Competition [CLS] [SEP] Lucid Motors produces luxury vehicles that are supposed to be in line with Mercedes or Rolls Royce, making them the luxury of EVs. Lucid Motor’s CEO, Peter Rawlinson, was an executive at Tesla prior to joining Lucid Motors in 2013 and Rawlinson was influential in bringing Tesla’s Model S to market. He helped re-engineer the design of the Model 3 when he joined Tesla in 2009. Rawlinson was Vice President of Engineering at Tesla and Chief Vehicle Engineer of the Model S. Lucid, the California-based start-up, announced its transition into the EV market, from making EV batteries in 2016 with its first model, the Lucid Air, being released in the second half of 2022. [CLS] [SEP] Lucid Air Vs Tesla Model S [CLS] [SEP] Source: Lucid Air Vs Tesla Model S: Range, Price, Efficiency Compared [CLS] [SEP] The Lucid Air will directly compete with Tesla’s Model S Plaid, which is Tesla’s fastest and most luxurious car yet. Tesla’s Model S Plaid goes from 0-60 MPH in 3.1 seconds while Lucid does 0-60 MPH in 2.7 seconds and beats the Plaid version on range. Lucid’s high-tech luxurious cars will enter a crowded luxury car market and look to create a similar buzz to that of Tesla when it first released its Roadster. [CLS] [SEP] Xpeng is a Chinese EV company and is expected to release its P5 model in China this October for $27,400. Xpeng uses lidar for its autonomous driving, which differs from Tesla’s approach of using cameras to create a “vision” approach. Lidar shoots lasers and essentially creates 3-D maps to sense its surroundings. Xpeng’s P5 will directly compete with Tesla’s Model 3 as it offers lower prices with similar ranges. [CLS] [SEP] Tesla-clone Xpeng now even copies Tesla [CLS] [SEP] Source: Tesla-clone Xpeng now even copies Tesla's website [CLS] [SEP] Xpeng is one of the up-and-coming Chinese EVs and will compete with Tesla in China when its cars are released next month. There are 300-plus EV makers in China and there will be more competition and consolidation within this market. Other Chinese EV companies like Nio are a threat to Tesla as well as other startups' EVs such as Rivian, another California-based startup, which is backed by Ford and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). [CLS] [SEP] China Threat [CLS] [SEP] There were 1.3 million EVs sold in China last year, which means that China accounted for 41% of global EV sales. Prior to 2020, China welcomed Tesla and made accommodations for it, such as removing Tesla from the 10% new-vehicle tax or helping Tesla get its manufacturing sites up and running faster than usual. China used Tesla to encourage competition within China EV companies that weren’t producing competitive EVs to fulfill the demand and consumer expectations within the country. China saw the need for EVs within its country and used Tesla to fulfill the demand. [CLS] [SEP] Now, China doesn’t need Tesla to support the demand in EVs as companies like Nio, BYO, and XPeng now offer competitive alternatives. The CCP most likely would prefer to support local companies rather than enable a U.S. company to be the leading EV seller in China. We’ve seen the threat of political intervention in Chinese tech stocks, and Tesla could face a similar threat. Tesla recently had some recalls for Model 3s in China as some were experiencing random accelerations. The Chinese EV market is expected to grow significantly, but the political risk and risk from local competition make Tesla’s future in the region hazy. [CLS] [SEP] Clearly, Tesla has a lot working against them on the competition front as well as in China. However, Tesla still has a first-mover advantage and is collecting a significant amount of data that will help prevent and reduce car accidents. [CLS] [SEP] Tesla's Data Will Win Out [CLS] [SEP] Tesla takes a vision approach to its autonomous driving, which means that it uses the cameras and sensors on its cars to act as the eyes of the vehicle while its software is essentially the brain and powered by AI. The more data you feed into AI, the better and better it gets. Dojo is Tesla’s “neural network” which was developed in-house and processes video that Tesla collects. Dojo is used to oversee the prediction process in its cars. Tesla recently announced its D1 chip that will be the fastest training computer for AI (according to a Tesla employee) which will be crucial for enabling the AI that should be necessary for fully autonomous vehicles. [CLS] [SEP] Tesla [CLS] [SEP] For Tesla’s competitors taking the lidar approach, it's much easier for them to reach level 3 or 4 of autonomy, but much more difficult for them to scale to level 5. Lidar usually is much more expensive than the approach Tesla is taking as the cost of a Waymo car with Lidar is estimated to cost $180,000 while a Model 3 costs $37,490. Tesla’s approach differs from the lidar approach as it is extremely difficult to start with a vision approach as Tesla’s software starts knowing nothing and must completely learn how to drive by accumulating more data. This happens by Tesla’s software collecting miles and real data. The image above highlights how this will pay off as it will be easier for Tesla to scale to reach level 5 automation. [CLS] [SEP] Estimated Tesla Autopilot Miles [CLS] [SEP] Source: Tesla Vehicle Deliveries and Autopilot Mileage Statistics - Lex Fridman [CLS] [SEP] As Tesla accumulates more data, its software gets continually better and better, making it difficult to get off the ground, but once it gets to level 3 of autonomy, it's much easier to scale to fully autonomous level 5. Tesla already is at level 2 autonomy, while Musk has said that Tesla will have level 5 autonomy by the end of 2021. Musk is known to be extremely optimistic when it comes to Tesla’s ambitions and future releases, so I don’t expect this to be any different, but Tesla is still ahead of its competitors when it comes to collecting data. [CLS] [SEP] Levels of driving automation [CLS] [SEP] Source: The 6 Levels of Vehicle Autonomy Explained | Synopsys Automotive [CLS] [SEP] Tesla’s system is powered by AI and this is only possible because of the abundance of data that Tesla collects whether during the manufacturing process or while its vehicles are on the road. The information that Tesla collects will empower fully autonomous vehicles, but more importantly it will allow Tesla to outsource its autonomous driving software as well as use AI to offer products such as Tesla Insurance. [CLS] [SEP] Tesla, Waymo and Traditional car makers [CLS] [SEP] Source: #283: AI Day Highlighted Tesla's Artificial Intelligence Prowess, & More - ARK Invest [CLS] [SEP] Tesla Insurance - Tesla is extremely vertically integrated. Tesla makes their own parts, writes its own code, as well as handles the sales for its vehicles, so there’s no better company that understands Tesla cars than Tesla itself. This is because Tesla has so many vehicles on the road today equipped with autonomous driving capabilities, specifically Tesla’s latest autopilot hardware that collects information from eight cameras and 12 ultrasonic sensors on the vehicle. It’s Tesla’s wide-vertical expansion that enables it to truly benefit from manufacturing the hardware and engineering the software to go along with it. Tesla sees that its AI will be its best asset to leverage moving forward, thanks to its growing amount of data. [CLS] [SEP] For example, usually, actuaries analyze the risk using math and statistics to design insurance policies. However, Tesla Insurance leverages the vast amount of data collected from Tesla vehicles to better position its underwriters to offer competitive quotes. This results in better quotes for more rewarding drivers and results in one’s insurance being decided by their driving behavior rather than statistics and categories one falls under. Tesla insurance is currently offered in California, while it’s expected to be rolled out in Texas, Washington, and Illinois. [CLS] [SEP] Similar to how Tesla’s Autonomous Driving gets better with more data and will eventually hit full self-driving, Tesla’s insurance offering should get better as well. Tesla’s data collection is still a competitive differentiation and Tesla will need to monetize its proprietary data and AI whether that’s offering new products or services like ride hauling or outsourcing its software to other legacy automakers. Tesla’s data will prove its greatest asset over time. [CLS] [SEP] Now, let’s explore Tesla’s valuation. [CLS] [SEP] Pricey Valuation [CLS] [SEP] TSLA stock Pricey Valuation [CLS] [SEP] Source: Ycharts.com [CLS] [SEP] Tesla is trading at 325x price to FCF while it sports 20x price to sales. Tesla is expected to generate ~$50 billion in revenue in 2021, while its market cap is $755 billion. Tesla's valuation is optimistic and accelerated growth already is being priced into the share price which will make it difficult for Tesla's multiples to expand or remain this high, as its business matures. Tesla’s main automotive operations are a low-margin business (24% gross profit margins). Therefore, the market is trading Tesla at a premium. [CLS] [SEP] Tesla Valuation [CLS] [SEP] To evaluate a fair value for Tesla, we'll deploy the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model. The model consists of a discounted cash flow model using free cash flow per share to assist in identifying Tesla’s value today, taking into account the change in shares outstanding. Additionally, the model uses the growth of free cash flow per share to determine Tesla's 10-year price target, and thereby, market cap, allowing us to project Tesla’s growth over the next 10 years. [CLS] [SEP] Assumptions: [CLS] [SEP] Forward 12-month revenue [A] [CLS] [SEP] $60 billion [CLS] [SEP] Potential Free Cash Flow Margin [B] [CLS] [SEP] 10% [CLS] [SEP] Average diluted shares outstanding [C] [CLS] [SEP] ~1.12 billion [CLS] [SEP] Free cash flow per share [ D = (A * B) / C ] [CLS] [SEP] $5.36 [CLS] [SEP] Free cash flow per share growth rate [CLS] [SEP] 30% [CLS] [SEP] Terminal growth rate [CLS] [SEP] 3% [CLS] [SEP] Years of elevated growth [CLS] [SEP] 10 [CLS] [SEP] Total years to stimulate [CLS] [SEP] 100 [CLS] [SEP] Discount Rate (Our "Next Best Alternative") [CLS] [SEP] 9.8% [CLS] [SEP] TSLA stock L.A. Stevens Valuation Model [CLS] [SEP] Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation Model [CLS] [SEP] Based on our model, Tesla’s share price is nearly 50% overvalued trading at $755 per share. Investors are paying a hefty price if they choose to invest in Tesla today, especially given the rise in stock price over the past 18 months. [CLS] [SEP] Expected Return [CLS] [SEP] TSLA stock expected return [CLS] [SEP] Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation Model [CLS] [SEP] An investment today is expected to generate an 11% annual return, which is below the 15% hurdle rate we use. Therefore, Tesla returns aren’t attractive for long-term investors while there are better places to invest capital in stocks whose market cap isn’t as stretched as with Tesla. [CLS] [SEP] For the model, I used a 10% free cash flow margin and a 30% growth rate in free cash flow over the next 10 years. A 10% free cash flow margin is conservative as Tesla sports a 9.5% gross profit margin. Tesla is growing revenues at nearly 100% year-over-year, so a 30% growth rate in free cash flow should prove accurate over the next 10 years. [CLS] [SEP] Risks [CLS] [SEP] Tesla is collecting vast amounts of data from more than 1 million Teslas on the road today. Musk has been adamant that Tesla self-driving capabilities will be at full automation by the end of 2021, but I fear that this is way too early for investors to expect FSD. Tesla technically hasn't passed level 2 autonomy and it could be a few years away from releasing FSD software. [CLS] [SEP] The supply-chain shortages also could negatively impact Tesla's near future as Tesla already has pushed by the long-waited release of its Cyber Truck and the Roadster. [CLS] [SEP] Other risks that Tesla faces are the increasing rise of competitors in the market as Legacy automakers are now releasing EVs. This risk as well as risks in China were highlighted above. [CLS] [SEP] Conclusion [CLS] [SEP] Tesla is on top of the EV market, it set the standard, and now it's facing competition from all angles as the incumbents and new companies look to redefine the EV standard that Tesla established. I don't think the competition will necessarily dethrone Tesla, but its high valuation makes the share price too high, considering that competition and large market opportunity for other companies. Tesla's remains extremely well positioned to continue to collect data and build the optimal AI software that will enable Tesla to expand its revenue streams. [CLS] [SEP] I’ve been a long-time investor in Tesla and have no plans on selling anytime soon, but the valuation leads me to rate the stock as “avoid” when considering adding new capital to the position.
Better Beer Stock: Ambev or Boston Beer Company? [CLS] [SEP] ABEV – Even though beer consumption dipped last year, the reopening of restaurants this year has been pushing up beer company sales. That is why we think it could be wise now to evaluate established beer companies Ambev (ABEV) and Boston Beer (SAM) to identify which one is a better buy now? Read more to find out. [CLS] [SEP] Nimesh JaiswalBy Nimesh Jaiswal [CLS] [SEP] Sep 14, 2021 [CLS] [SEP]  [CLS] [SEP] Based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Ambev S.A. (ABEV - Get Rating) produces, distributes, sells beer, draft beer, carbonated soft drinks, other non-alcoholic beverages, malt, and food products. Its segments include Brazil, Central America and the Caribbean, Latin America South, and Canada. In comparison, The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM - Get Rating) produces and sells alcoholic beverages primarily in the United States. In addition to its flagship beer—Samuel Adams Boston Lager—it also offers hard ciders and hard seltzers under the Twisted Tea, Angry Orchard, Dogfish Head, and Concrete Beach brand names. [CLS] [SEP] The beer industry suffered a setback amid the COVID-19 pandemic due to a dip in retail beer sales, with several stadiums, concert venues, bars, and restaurants closing their doors or operating at limited capacity. However, beer consumption is expected to increase in the coming months with the reopening of bars and restaurants with precautions to limit the spread of COVID-19. According to a Business Wire report, the global beer market is expected to reach $710.89 billion by 2025. So, both ABEV and SAM should benefit. [CLS] [SEP] ABEV has gained 0.3% in price year-to-date, while SAM generated negative returns. Also, ABEV’s 11.6% gains over the past nine months are higher than SAM’s negative returns. Furthermore, ABEV is the clear winner in terms of the past nine months’ performance, with 34.1% price gains versus SAM’s negative returns. [CLS] [SEP] But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out. [CLS] [SEP] Latest Developments [CLS] [SEP] ABEV’s CEO Jean Jereissati said  on July 29, 2021, that “Our commercial strategy, innovations, tech platforms and operational excellence delivered the highest consolidated volumes in a second-quarter on record. When looking at rolling 12 months consolidated volumes, we are now at all-time high levels, 5 million hectoliters above our peak in 2015.” [CLS] [SEP] Last month,  SAM and PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) announced  plans to enter a business collaboration to produce HARD MTN DEW alcoholic beverages. With adult drinkers’ tastes  evolving, SAM could witness increasing demand for this beverage. [CLS] [SEP] Recent Financial Results [CLS] [SEP] 7 SEVERELY UNDERVALUED STOCKS [CLS] [SEP] ABEV’s net revenue increased 35.3% year-over-year to R$15.71 billion ($3 billion) for its fiscal second quarter ended June 30, 2021. The company’s normalized EBITDA grew 58% year-over-year to R$5.29 billion ($1.01 billion). Its normalized profit increased 115.9% year-over-year to R$2.96 billion ($565.34 million), while its normalized EPS came in at R$0.19 ($0.04), up 119.8% year-over-year. [CLS] [SEP] SAM’s net revenue increased 33.3% year-over-year to $602.80 million for its fiscal second quarter, ended June 26, 2021. In addition, the company’s total assets grew 13.2% year-over-year to $1.56 billion. However, its net income decreased 1.6% year-over-year to $59.19 million, while its EPS came in at $4.75, down 2.7% year-over-year. [CLS] [SEP] Past and Expected Financial Performance [CLS] [SEP] ABEV’s revenue and EPS have grown at CAGRs of 10.3% and 22.7%, respectively, over the past three years. Analysts expect ABEV’s revenue to increase 39.9% for the quarter ending September 30, 2021, and 16% in its fiscal year 2021. However, the company’s EPS is expected to decline 37.5% for the quarter ending December 31, 2021. Again, its EPS is expected to grow at a 7.4% rate  per annum over the next five years. [CLS] [SEP] In comparison , SAM’s revenue and EPS have grown  at CAGRs of 43.7% and 33.1%, respectively, over the past three years. The company’s revenue is expected to increase 8.9% for the quarter ending September 30, 2021, and 24.6% in its fiscal year 2021. Its EPS is expected to climb 5.7% for the quarter ending December 31, 2021. Also, SAM’s EPS is expected to grow at a 25% rate  per annum over the next five years. [CLS] [SEP] Profitability [CLS] [SEP] ABEV’s trailing-12-month revenue is 6.37 times SAM’s. ABEV is also more profitable, with 52.6% and 21.9% respective  gross profit  and net income margins, versus SAM’s 46.9% and 11.3%. [CLS] [SEP] However, SAM’s ROE, ROA, and ROTC of 24.94%, 13.84%, and 18.66%, respectively, are higher than ABEV’s 19.16%, 8.50%, and 12.57%. [CLS] [SEP] Valuation [CLS] [SEP] In terms of forward non-GAAP P/E, SAM is currently trading at 31.03x, which is 35.9% higher than ABEV’s 22.83x. Moreover, SAM’s 18.03x forward EV/EBITDA ratio is 61.4% higher than ABEV’s 11.17x. [CLS] [SEP] So, ABEV is the more affordable stock.

Carnival says cruise bookings for 2022 second half above pre-pandemic levels [CLS] [SEP] KEY POINTS [CLS] [SEP] Carnival Corp said on Friday cruise bookings for the second half of 2022 were ahead of pre-pandemic levels. [CLS] [SEP] Carnival said its voyages for the third quarter were cash flow positive, adding that it expects the trend to continue. [CLS] [SEP] The company, which reported a third-quarter adjusted loss of $1.99 billion, said its monthly average cash burn rate was $510 million during the reported quarter. [CLS] [SEP] In this article [CLS] [SEP] CCL [CLS] [SEP] -0.14 (-0.53%) [CLS] [SEP] A Carnival cruise ship is docked, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, in Long Beach, California, U.S., April 7, 2021. [CLS] [SEP] A Carnival cruise ship is docked, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, in Long Beach, California, U.S., April 7, 2021. [CLS] [SEP] Lucy Nicholson | Reuters [CLS] [SEP] Carnival Corp said on Friday cruise bookings for the second half of 2022 were ahead of pre-pandemic levels, in a sign the cruise operator expects a rebound in business as it restarts voyages globally. [CLS] [SEP] The cruise sector has been among those most affected by the pandemic as many ships docked at ports and anchored offshore for months without passengers, forcing operators to raise billions of dollars in debt to stay afloat. [CLS] [SEP] Some cruise enthusiasts are looking forward to the resumption of more voyages from U.S. ports after the country’s health officials gave the green light earlier this year for Carnival and its rivals to restart operations. [CLS] [SEP] Carnival said its voyages for the third quarter were cash flow positive, adding that it expects the trend to continue. [CLS] [SEP] Eight of the company’s nine cruise line brands have resumed sailings with passengers onboard, and it expects more than half its total fleet capacity to be open for guests by the end of October. [CLS] [SEP] However, Carnival said its booking volumes for future cruises during the third quarter were not as robust as the second quarter due to the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus. [CLS] [SEP] Rival Norwegian Cruise Line said it saw a modest decrease in net new booking activity in July following a surge in Covid-19 cases, while Royal Caribbean also flagged a modest hit to its bookings from the fast-spreading variant. [CLS] [SEP] Carnival expects its monthly average cash burn rate for the fourth quarter to be higher than the prior quarters, as it prepares its ships for voyages after more than a year. [CLS] [SEP] The company, which reported a third-quarter adjusted loss of $1.99 billion, said its monthly average cash burn rate was $510 million during the reported quarter.
Norwegian Cruise Line Officially Returns to New York [CLS] [SEP] Norwegian Cruise Line is continuing to ramp up operations, this time from The Big Apple. [CLS] [SEP] On Sunday, Sept. 26, Norwegian Breakaway made its post-COVID debut back in New York City, the start of a season of week-long sailings to Bermuda for the ship. [CLS] [SEP] The ship will welcome guests from the Manhattan Cruise Terminal through the end of October, sailings that include overnight calls to the Royal Naval Dockyard. [CLS] [SEP] It will then reposition to New Orleans following a 14-day journey to the Caribbean with calls to Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic; Willemstad, Curacao; Oranjestad, Aruba; Colón, Panama; Puerto Limón, Costa Rica; George Town, Grand Cayman; and Cozumel, Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] In a statement, Norwegian president and CEO Harry Sommer called the news “a significant milestone in our Great Cruise Comeback from the U.S.” [CLS] [SEP] "We have a 30-year history of cruising from New York and were the first to sail from the destination year-round. Our return feels like a homecoming. This fall, as New York comes back to life after more than a year, with Broadway and other top attractions opening back up, we are honored to be part of its story and to provide travelers easy access to a safe and exceptional warm-weather vacation experience from one of the top cruise destinations on the East Coast." [CLS] [SEP] The ship is the 6th of Norwegian’s 17-ship fleet to restart since the July restart of Norwegian Jade. Most recently, Norwegian Epic and Norwegian Getaway both returned to normal operations in the Mediterranean. [CLS] [SEP] All of Norwegian’s 2021 sailings will require guests to be fully vaccinated. It's part of NCL's plan to sail in an environment that Frank Del Rio considers "the safest place on earth."
AMC takes advantage of pandemic to expand presence in one notable city: Tinseltown [CLS] [SEP] One of the casualties of the pandemic was the permanent closing of the ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific Theatres chains. ArcLight Cinemas had 11 locations, including a half-dozen in the Los Angeles area, as well as San Diego; two in Chicago; the Washington, D.C., area; and Boston. Pacific Theatres had six cinemas, all in the L.A. area. [CLS] [SEP] The move flooded the Los Angeles market with more than 400,000 square feet of movie theater real estate — "an opportunity major chains such as Regal, AMC and Cinemark will likely capitalize on as the three make up nearly 70% of the regional cinema market," CBRE Group Inc. noted in a recent report. [CLS] [SEP] Leawood-based AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE: AMC) became one of the first movers when it took over Pacific Theatres' flagship theaters, signing long-term leases for the 30,000-square-foot Grove and 43,412-square-foot Americana at Brand cinemas at the Los Angeles and Glendale, California, retail and entertainment complexes owned by luxury real estate developer Caruso. And Regal Cinemas signed a lease to take over the 87,000-square-foot ArcLight theater at the Sherman Oaks Galleria. [CLS] [SEP] That leaves several movie houses and hundreds of thousands of square feet still up for grabs in Tinseltown. [CLS] [SEP] "The silver screen hasn't lost its luster as some of the biggest players in the industry move to increase their regional footprint,” the CBRE report said.
China: New Oriental closes K-12 subsidiary [CLS] [SEP] Founded in 2016, DFUB is described as New Oriental’s most successful online education service, with over 2 million students registered in its 282 branches. It enabled students in less developed areas to be taught by experienced teachers in Beijing via online platforms. [CLS] [SEP] The company estimates that it will finish issuing refunds and redundancy packages before October, according to a social media post by CEO of DFUB Yu Zhu. [CLS] [SEP] “It’s heartbreaking that I have to leave but nobody can do anything about it,” a former teacher at DFUB told the PIE. [CLS] [SEP] “But I’m glad about the compensation I received.” The teacher had worked at DFUB for a year and she received compensation that equals to two months of her salary. [CLS] [SEP] “There will be more teachers leaving New Oriental in the future” [CLS] [SEP] The announcement comes in the wake of China’s recent national reforms to the tutoring industry, turning existing businesses into nonprofit entities by the end of the year and barring them from stock market financing. [CLS] [SEP] The overhaul is part of measures to relieve pressure on school students and reduce cost burdens on parents, according to officials. [CLS] [SEP] A former teacher at New Oriental in Beijing told the PIE that some of his colleagues had left the company and it is likely that there will be more people leaving the K-12 sector. [CLS] [SEP] “The new policy banned tutoring companies from providing lessons on weekends and holidays, so fewer teachers are needed for the industry.” [CLS] [SEP] New Oriental is among the leading education companies whose market value has dived under the influence of China’s new national tutoring rules. New Oriental’s US-listed shares have fallen by £5.4 billion since July, according to Reuters. [CLS] [SEP] “We will strictly follow the rules, continue to improve the quality of education and facilitate the students’ all-round development,” said in a statement released by New Oriental. [CLS] [SEP] Minhong Yu, the founder and chairman of New Oriental said “I wrote letters to our teachers every year to express appreciation but I don’t have the courage to do so this year,” according to his social media post on Chinese Teacher’s Day on September 10. [CLS] [SEP] “Many teachers have been dismissed and there will be more teachers leaving New Oriental in the future. This is the saddest Teacher’s Day to me.” [CLS] [SEP] Related articles [CLS] [SEP] China to tighten grip on edtech industry and online learning [CLS] [SEP] GoStudent valued at €1.4bn, becomes unicorn [CLS] [SEP] Edtech: AECC launches course search platform [CLS] [SEP] China: edtech companies to stop using tutors based overseas
Fresno County Will Soon Be Home to the Largest Green Hydrogen Plant on the West Coast [CLS] [SEP] A leader in fuel cell solutions, Plug Power recently announced it will build the largest green hydrogen production plant on the West Coast. The state-of-the-art production facility in Fresno County in the Central Valley of California will be powered by renewable energy. Once completed, it will produce 30 metric tons of green hydrogen daily and serve customers up and down the West Coast. [CLS] [SEP] The project also includes the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility that will supply the water needed by the plant and provide recycled water to Mendota, an increasingly water-stressed agricultural hub in Fresno County. [CLS] [SEP] The California facility will expand Plug Power’s network of plants that already includes sites in New York, Tennessee and Georgia. Combined, they will supply 500 tons of liquid green hydrogen daily by 2025, preventing 4.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions from entering the atmosphere. [CLS] [SEP] What is green hydrogen? [CLS] [SEP] At the California plant, Plug Power will use electrolyzers to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through the electrolysis of water. Since the system will be powered by a 300-megawatt solar array, the only emissions created will be oxygen. [CLS] [SEP] Although hydrogen itself is a green fuel, it can be associated with large amounts of carbon dioxide emissions in the manufacturing process. Almost all (99.6 percent) of the hydrogen on the market is produced using fossil fuels. For example, brown hydrogen is produced from coal and gray hydrogen from natural gas. [CLS] [SEP] Therefore, not all hydrogen is created equal from a sustainability standpoint. Because hydrogen is very energy-dense, the production process is energy-intensive. Using brown or gray hydrogen is similar to driving an electric vehicle and charging it with electricity generated from coal. Although the car itself would have minimal emissions, it creates a demand for polluting energy sources. [CLS] [SEP] Is green hydrogen cost-competitive? [CLS] [SEP] “When fully built, the network of plants in the U.S. will offer transportation fuel to customers that is price-competitive with diesel," Plug Power claims in a press statement. "In addition, Plug Power’s investment in green hydrogen production will contribute to decarbonizing light-duty vehicles, freight-transportation, and logistics operations, and supports California’s leading role in developing hydrogen as a zero-emission fuel.” [CLS] [SEP] Research firm Wood McKenzie expects green hydrogen prices to fall by 64 percent by 2040. Currently, China and the United States account for 21 percent and 19 percent of global demand. However, one obstacle to large-scale adoption is the current lack of infrastructure, including fueling stations and pipelines. Removing these obstacles would make green hydrogen more cost-effective. [CLS] [SEP] Some of this could change with the new infrastructure bill making its way through Congress and a potential extension of the investment tax credit (an incentive for wind and solar energy). Nevertheless, the falling cost of solar and wind energy is excellent news for the green hydrogen market. [CLS] [SEP] Why is green hydrogen so appealing? [CLS] [SEP] Green hydrogen presents opportunities to lower carbon emissions from specific sectors that are especially polluting, such as the chemical, iron, steel and long-haul transportation sectors. [CLS] [SEP] Many delivery fleets, including at DHL, Amazon, UPS, FedEx, Walmart and the U.S. Postal Service, are starting to electrify. But some of the logistics around batteries are challenging for long-haul trucking, freight shipping and air travel. Transporting heavy batteries is inefficient and takes up space, and refueling can be time consuming. By contrast, hydrogen is energy-dense, thus it is space efficient and offers quick refueling. [CLS] [SEP] The Plug Power announcement signals the green hydrogen market is advancing. Pending required permits, the company expects to break ground in early 2023 and begin production in early 2024. Lee Ann Eager, president and CEO of the Fresno County Economic Development Corp., is also counting it as a win for the region, which has some of the poorest year-round air quality in the U.S. and is now choking on smoke from nearby wildfires. [CLS] [SEP] “Green hydrogen represents the energy of the future, and with this major announcement, Fresno County will soon plant its flag as the strategic center for California’s hydrogen economy,” she said. “This project is poetic justice for our region, which has struggled with persistent poor air quality and will produce the zero-emission fuel needed to support the state’s renewable energy goals.” [CLS] [SEP] Image credit: Tommy Lisbin/Unsplash
AMD CEO Sees Chip Shortage Easing in 2022 [CLS] [SEP] The semiconductor shortage will begin to ease in 2022, Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su said at a session Monday at the Code Conference in Beverly Hills. [CLS] [SEP] In an on-stage interview with Code Conference producer Kara Swisher and CNBC tech reporter Jon Fortt, the AMD (ticker: AMD) chief said that the semiconductor industry is investing aggressively in new capacity, with 20 new factories coming online this year and a similar number expected to come online in 2022. [CLS] [SEP] But Su also noted that the pandemic has “taken demand to a new level,” with every industry seeking more components. “Nobody expected this much demand,” she says. [CLS] [SEP] Su dodged a question about whether AMD was threatened by a shift by some electronics companies to chips designed in house. [CLS] [SEP] Su also said the company continues to expect to close its pending acquisition of Xilinx (XLNX) by year end. She also said that consolidation in the chip industry is “inevitable.” [CLS] [SEP] Asked about the use of AMD chips for crypto currency mining, Su said it is a small part of its business. She says the company is trying hard to get more products to gamers and the core business, rather than on crypto. [CLS] [SEP] Write to Eric J. Savitz at eric.savitz@barrons.com
New Benchmark Leak Reveals Impressive Performance Of Intel's 12900K, 12700K And 12600K Alder Lake Processors [CLS] [SEP] Benchmarks have leaked supposedly revealing the performance of Intel's Core i9-12900K, Core i7-12700K and Core i5-12600K Alder Lake CPUs, courtesy of www.cpu-monkey.com. [CLS] [SEP] The new results show both single-threaded and multi-threaded scores in Cinebench R20 and give Intel a clear lead over all of AMD's current mainstream desktop CPUs. [CLS] [SEP] Below you can see my own recent benchmark results from my reviews of Intel's 111th Gen CPUs such as the Core i9-11900K in Cinebench R20 along with the leaked results for the Core i5-12600K, Core i7-12700K and Core i9-12900K Alder Lake CPUs. [CLS] [SEP] The Core i9-12900K's result of 817 in the single-threaded testis miles ahead of AMD's Ryzen 9 5950X - it's best result, and the latter is even bettered by the Core i5-12600K, which scored 750. Admittedly, single-threaded performance isn't an indicator of general performance, but we can see just how much faster the new CPUs are compared to both AMD and Intel's current models on a single-threaded basis.

The Core i7-12700K was also snapping at the heels of the AMD 16-core CPU, despite a four-core deficit. [CLS] [SEP] Speaking of cores, it's worth remembering that Intel will be using hybrid cores with its Alder Lake CPUs. Each CPU will comprise big or 'performance' cores as well as smaller 'efficient' cores. [CLS] [SEP] MORE FROM FORBES [CLS] [SEP] Intel Alder Lake Processors: Surprise 'Thread Director' Feature Revealed, More Xe Graphics Details too [CLS] [SEP] By Antony Leather [CLS] [SEP] The former are hyper-threaded, but the latter are not. For example, the Core i9-12900K will have two threads for each of its eight performance cores (16 threads) but only one thread for each of its efficient cores. This means that despite being a 16-core CPU like AMD's Ryzen 9 5950X, it only has 24 threads instead of 32. [CLS] [SEP] However, as we can see above, if these benchmarks are to be believed, the thread deficit doesn't mean much as the CPU is gaining a lot of ground thanks to its new architecture as well as performance enhancements such as Thread Director, that will mean its Alder Lake CPUs will run faster on Windows 11. [CLS] [SEP] I'll be reviewing the new CPUs when they're released so follow me here on Forbes for the latest PC hardware news and reviews and don't forget to check me out on YouTube, Instagram and Facebook as well.
Micron Correction Slowly Coming to an End [CLS] [SEP] Micron Technology Inc. (MU) reports Q4 2021 earnings after Tuesday’s closing bell, with analysts looking for a profit of $2.34 per-share on $8.21 billion in revenue. If met, earnings-per-share (EPS) will more than double the profit posted in the same quarter last year. The stock sold off 5.7% after beating Q3 estimates and raising Q4 EPS guidance in late June and fell another 14% into August before bouncing a few points into this week. It’s booked a negative 1% 2021 return-to-date after gaining nearly 40% last year. [CLS] [SEP] Headwinds Could Persist into 2022 [CLS] [SEP] The company has been plagued by supply disruptions, like other semiconductor manufacturers, compounded by weakness in DRAM memory pricing. Well-known hedge funds have taken notice during the quarter, reducing or closing positions at funds run by George Soros, Stanley Druckenmiller, and David Tepper. Worse yet, Micron continues to underperform other chip stocks by a country mile, dropping 14% in the last three months while PHLX Semiconductor Index hit an all-time high less than two weeks ago. [CLS] [SEP] Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini sounded upbeat last week, despite lowering the firm’s target from $150 to $135, noting “Although recent checks suggest a flattening in blended DRAM/NAND ASPs into YE21 and early 2022, we have decided to reduce estimates to reflect a worst case scenario of down low single digit in Nov-Q and down mid-single digit in Feb-Q. Nonetheless, with stock trading at ~6x our updated CY22 PE and actually down YTD, we argue that worst case scenario is already dialed into the share price”. [CLS] [SEP] Wall Street and Technical Outlook [CLS] [SEP] Wall Street consensus has missed the mark, with a ‘Buy’ rating based upon 27 ‘Buy’, 1 ‘Overweight’, and 4 ‘Hold’ recommendations. No analysts are recommending that shareholders close positions and move to the sidelines. Price targets currently range from a low of $75 to a Street-high $165 while the stock is set to open Monday’s session more than a point below the low target. Worse yet, this target has acted as an impenetrable price ceiling for the last seven weeks. [CLS] [SEP] Micron Technology stalled less than a point below 2000’s all-time high at 97.50 in April and entered a steep correction that pierced the 200-day moving average in the 70s in August. The stock has traded below that barrier since that time but signs of accumulation should limit downside in coming weeks, regardless of this week‘s metrics. In addition, a monthly Stochastics sell cycle is finally approaching the oversold level, predicting fourth quarter bottoming action.

Why Nvidia Investors Are Nervous Today [CLS] [SEP] What happened [CLS] [SEP] Product shortages are generally bad for business -- unless you're in the business of making the product that's in short supply. It's for this reason that shares of semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) -- a supplier of chips for everything from playing video games to mining cryptocurrency to performing artificial intelligence tasks -- have benefited so much from the global semiconductor shortage over the past couple of years, more than doubling in 2020 and gaining another 65% so far this year. But all good things must come to an end. As of 11:29 a.m. EDT today, shares were down 2.22%. [CLS] [SEP] And Elon Musk says this semiconductor shortage will end as well. [CLS] [SEP] Short circuit on a semiconductor chip. [CLS] [SEP] IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. [CLS] [SEP] So what [CLS] [SEP] As Reuters reports, the CEO of electric car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) characterized the shortage that's been strangling production of automobiles this year as "short term I think," when speaking on a panel Friday during Italian Tech Week. [CLS] [SEP] Chipmakers are building new semiconductor plants, and planning to build even more, to capitalize on the global shortage of computer chips and the high prices that this has spawned. As a result, Musk predicts that "we will have good capacity for providing chips by next year." [CLS] [SEP] Now what [CLS] [SEP] Precisely when next year this capacity will come on line, and how long it will take for chip production to catch up with backlogged demand, remains an open question. Still, Musk's comments tally with predictions from market intelligence source IDC earlier last week, which forecast "easing" of the shortage "through 4Q21," "normalization and balance by the middle of 2022," and even "a potential for overcapacity in 2023 as larger scale capacity expansions begin to come online toward the end of 2022." [CLS] [SEP] Suffice it to say this is probably why Nvidia investors are nervous today and bidding its stock down. The semiconductors industry has historically been cyclical, characterized by busts as well as booms. If this cycle resumes in 2022, or even 2023, then the gains Nvidia stock has enjoyed over the past two years could prove just as short term as the chip shortage itself.
Can India’s proposed semiconductor deal with Taiwan be a gamechanger? [CLS] [SEP] Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a microchip will double every two years, even while costs go down. Mister Moore, God bless him, surely may not have accounted for COVID-19, developments in artificial intelligence and the perfect storm of it all coming together, leading to a global shortage of semiconductors threatening industries from automobiles to smartphones and consumer electronics. [CLS] [SEP] Moore's Law will also be put to test as India doubles down on closing a reported deal with Taiwan, the big daddy in the semiconductor scene. The deal, worth Rs 55,000 crore in today's dollar value, envisages a big-scale chip production facility with Taiwanese technology in the sub continent. The larger trade deal (that will, of course, make big bro Beijing see red) in the offing could see duty cuts on components and other raw materials. A mega IT park with space for 100 Taiwanese companies is also on the anvil. [CLS] [SEP] While it fits in with the whole 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' narrative of the government, the project really would not solve the semiconductor crisis right now. Even if the deal is signed on in the coming days, the whole process is likely to take years before it starts functioning. A Gartner report says the present semiconductor shortage is likely to last till the second half of next year, while the India-Taiwan project, even if it moves at lightning speed, may not be able to start production before 2023 at best. [CLS] [SEP] Not to forget, the logistics are daunting. First the government has to find the right location, and this is not just a matter of providing land. Even if one were to ignore the requirement of a seaport for easy access to imported components, any such facility will need a steady source of highly skilled workforce. [CLS] [SEP] “The semiconductor industry hires a lot of STEM PhDs with highly specialised training, and good semiconductor engineers are very rare,” according to semiconductor theorist Karan Mehta on Quora. “Semiconductor companies need a far better educated workforce than other industries.” [CLS] [SEP] Then there is the whole issue of scale. One of the reasons why there is a global shortage in semiconductors right now is because of the very nature of this product. First is the requirement of highly-skilled expertise. And Moore's law, if it still applies, ensures that with more chips being packed into even more smaller circuits, not only is technology getting extremely advanced, the cost factor is becoming a deterrent for non-mega-size players. [CLS] [SEP] On top of that, any semiconductor manufacturing facility requires massive investments. For example, this weekend, Intel announced two new chip fabrication plants (fobs) in Arizona, USA. The cost? Rs 1.4 lakh crore. The world's leading semiconductor manufacturer, Taiwan's TSMC, also started work on its new fob in Arizona back in June. The estimated cost of the project, TSMC's first outside of its home country in 20 years (India would definitely be hoping to be the second) is at least 88,000 crore rupees. The India-Taiwan figure of 55,000 actually fades in comparison to these. [CLS] [SEP] Such massive investment and infra only makes sense when any project has enough clients and orders to make good on the money spent – the reason why semiconductor industry has been limited to few giga-sized projects present in just a handful of countries. Explains a systems architect, “To be a winner, you must have both a long-term strategy and an excellent 'this-year' product. It is challenging and once you hit the top in your area, you will attract huge competition. It is a winner-takes-all industry.” [CLS] [SEP] On one level, the Indian project does seem sorted on that front, with companies ranging from local car makers to smartphone manufacturers being crippled in recent months due to shortage of semiconductors being imported – Maruti Suzuki, for example, curtailed production by more than half this month due to lack of semiconductors for use. But as the new Indian plant kickstarts operation, whenever it might be, it could rest assured with even more newer areas where its chipsets could come into play – the advent of 5G, for example. But the sailing is not going to be exactly smooth, with the advent of newer technology, especially AI, threatening to upend the field.
Taiwan Semiconductor Is A Chip Manufacturing Giant That Should Be On Investors' Radar [CLS] [SEP] Summary [CLS] [SEP] Taiwan Semiconductor is the world's biggest chip foundry, manufacturing semiconductors that are used in a wide range of devices. [CLS] [SEP] The company currently has a technological advantage, but there is a risk that competitors like Samsung and Intel could catch up. [CLS] [SEP] Shares are no longer cheap, with the market apparently re-rating the company from a cyclical company to a growth company. [CLS] [SEP] Silicon wafer negative color in machine in semiconductor manufacturing [CLS] [SEP] MACRO PHOTO/iStock via Getty Images [CLS] [SEP] Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is the world's biggest chip foundry, manufacturing semiconductors that are used in a wide range of devices. As its name implies, the company is based out of Taiwan, and it is a significant component of many emerging market ETFs such as the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM). [CLS] [SEP] Looking at the past few years both the share price and revenues have increased significantly. [CLS] [SEP] TSM stock chart [CLS] [SEP] Data by YCharts [CLS] [SEP] This has led to a re-rating of the company: before, it seemed to be valued as a cyclical company with a low P/E ratio, and now it looks to be valued as a growth company with a high P/E ratio implying significant growth ahead. [CLS] [SEP] TSM stock PE ratio [CLS] [SEP] Data by YCharts [CLS] [SEP] While we are not sure the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry is gone, we do believe that Taiwan Semiconductor is winning ground versus competitors. The growing competitive advantages of the company are reflected in a significantly higher operating margin compared to Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). These advantages are in part technological and in part manufacturing prowess. We won't get into the details of the manufacturing advantages of each of these companies, several articles such as this one making the point that Intel is set to regain the technological lead, while this other one argues that TSM is set to continue leading the pack. What we believe is clear is that at least for the time being TSM has a clear advantage when compared to its main competitors, and that is reflected in its much higher operating margins. [CLS] [SEP] Chart [CLS] [SEP] Data by YCharts [CLS] [SEP] Currently about half of the revenue of the company is from leading nodes, such as 5nm and 7nm with the other half being older nodes where equipment has already been significantly depreciated. [CLS] [SEP] Source: Taiwan Semiconductor Investor Relations [CLS] [SEP] Looking at the revenue by platform, most of it comes from sales of smartphone chips with a 42% contribution, and High Performance Computing with 39%. Internet of Things (IoT), Automotive, DCE, and others make up less than 10% each. [CLS] [SEP] Source: Taiwan Semiconductor Investor Relations [CLS] [SEP] What is clear is that TSM is a high-quality business, which has been earning high returns on equity as well as on invested capital. One important difference with many other high ROIC franchises is that TSM has a lot of opportunities to reinvest in the business given the fact the semiconductor manufacturing requires enormous capital expenditures. [CLS] [SEP] Chart [CLS] [SEP] Data by YCharts [CLS] [SEP] Valuation [CLS] [SEP] Our estimated fair value for the shares is based on analyst estimates for the next three years compiled by Seeking Alpha, and for the rest of the decade we use analyst's long-term growth estimates. We assume a GDP-like growth estimate for the terminal value growth, and discount the cash flows at 10% which is the minimum return we would be looking for from an investment such as this one. [CLS] [SEP] The resulting fair value estimate is $140, which is a bit higher than where shares are currently trading hinting at some undervaluation. However it is important to emphasize that this assumes growth for the next ten years, which would mean the semiconductor industry is no longer as cyclical as it was in the past.

[CLS] [SEP] Source: TSM ESG Report [CLS] [SEP] Source: Glassdoor.com [CLS] [SEP] Risks [CLS] [SEP] The main risks we see with an investment in Taiwan Semiconductor are: [CLS] [SEP] Semiconductor downturn risk: The semiconductor industry has a history of boom and bust cyclicality. Some believe it has transitioned to a more stable state, but that remains to be seen. [CLS] [SEP] Technology leadership risks: Taiwan Semiconductor is priced as the semiconductor manufacturing leader, but there is some risk that companies like Intel and Samsung could catch up to it at future technology nodes. [CLS] [SEP] Political and military risk: The People's Republic of China remains a threat to Taiwan, with an invasion of Taiwan not outside the realm of possibilities, which would lead to a destabilized Taiwanese economy, and potential losses for TSM shareholders. [CLS] [SEP] Conclusion [CLS] [SEP] Much hinges on whether the company is still cyclical or if it has truly transitioned into a growth company. The way we see it, an investment at these prices could work out well for long-term investors if two conditions are maintained, that TSM continues to be the technology leader of the pack and that the industry avoid another deep bust cycle. Otherwise we believe the best option for investors is to wait for more attractive prices by adding the company to a watch list for the time being.
In a huge blow, judge rules Apple can't force developers to exclusively use its App Store payment system [CLS] [SEP] (CNN Business)Apple can no longer prohibit app developers from directing users to payment options outside its App Store, a judge ruled on Friday. The decision, which followed a contentious court battle with the maker of the hugely popular Fortnite video game, is a major blow to Apple — but the company also scored a partial victory as the judge stopped short of calling it a monopoly. [CLS] [SEP] Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the US District Court in the Northern District of California ruled on Friday that Apple (AAPL) had violated California's Unfair Competition Law by forcing Fortnite and its maker Epic Games to use Apple's payment systems on the App Store, with the iPhone maker extracting a 30% commission on every in-app purchase in the process. She issued an injunction saying Apple can no longer prohibit developers from adding links within their apps to outside payment options; for example, alerting users to the option to pay for a subscription on a web browser, rather than through the app. [CLS] [SEP] But Gonzalez Rogers sided with Apple on the suit's other claims and said she could not conclude that the iPhone maker is a monopoly. [CLS] [SEP] "Given the trial record, the Court cannot ultimately conclude that Apple is a monopolist under either federal or state antitrust laws," court documents read. "Success is not illegal. The final trial record did not include evidence of other critical factors, such as barriers to entry and conduct decreasing output or decreasing innovation in the relevant market." [CLS] [SEP] The decision, which is almost certain to be appealed, came after a months-long legal fight that could change how we use our smartphones. [CLS] [SEP] Apple's stock was down nearly 3% in midday trading Friday following the decision. In a statement, and a followup press call, Apple framed the decision as a victory for the company and stressed that the court found it was not a monopolist. [CLS] [SEP] "Today the Court has affirmed what we've known all along: the App Store is not in violation of antitrust law," Apple said in a statement. "Apple faces rigorous competition in every segment in which we do business, and we believe customers and developers choose us because our products and services are the best in the world." [CLS] [SEP] In a series of tweets, Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said the company "will fight on." [CLS] [SEP] "Today's ruling isn't a win for developers or for consumers. Epic is fighting for fair competition among in-app payment methods and app stores for a billion consumers," Sweeney tweeted, continuing: "Fortnite will return to the iOS App Store when and where Epic can offer in-app payment in fair competition with Apple in-app payment, passing along the savings to consumers." [CLS] [SEP] A spokesperson for Epic confirmed the company plans to appeal the decision. [CLS] [SEP] The fight began last August when Apple kicked Fortnite off the App Store for flouting its rules on in-app payments on the iPhone. [CLS] [SEP] In a software update to Fortnite, Epic encouraged iOS players to buy the game's digital currency, known as V-Bucks, directly from Epic, as opposed to through Apple's in-app purchase system. To sweeten the deal, Epic offered a discount to those who bought V-Bucks directly. [CLS] [SEP] While consumers may have viewed it as a loyalty bonus, Apple saw it as a gross violation of its contract with Epic and an attempt to undercut a key revenue stream. The iPhone maker booted Fortnite from the App store, and Epic immediately filed what appeared to be a largely premeditated lawsuit. [CLS] [SEP] In a contentious trial that began in May and lasted nearly a month, Epic argued that the App Store constituted a monopoly because it is the only way to access hundreds of millions of iPhone users, and that Apple harmed competition by prohibiting other app stores or payment methods on its devices. [CLS] [SEP] The gaming company stressed that it is not seeking any monetary compensation from the lawsuit but wants the judge to compel Apple to relax some of those restrictions. "Epic is solely seeking changes to Apple's future behavior," the company's CEO, Tim Sweeney, said on the stand. [CLS] [SEP] Apple and its CEO Tim Cook sought to undercut that argument by pointing out that the iPhone is one of several devices where Fortnite users can play the game and buy V-bucks, including Android smartphones (Epic is fighting a similar lawsuit against Google) and video game consoles such as the PlayStation and Xbox, many of which also don't allow alternative payment methods and charge similar commissions. [CLS] [SEP] It's not illegal to have a monopoly under US law; it's only illegal to try to preserve a monopoly at the expense of competition. [CLS] [SEP] Apple also justified its 30% commission by saying the earnings from in-app payments help improve security and privacy for the iPhone users that give developers a massive captive audience. [CLS] [SEP] "We've made a choice," Cook told the judge. "There are clearly other ways to monetize, but we chose this one because this one overall is the best way." [CLS] [SEP] Apple's commissions on in-app payments — often referred to by developers as the "Apple Tax" — have been under fire from developers, lawmakers, and regulators around the world for years. And while the Epic lawsuit is one of the more high-profile legal challenges, it is one of many just within the past year alone. Music streaming service Spotify and dating app Tinder's parent company Match Group have been other notable antagonists, with the former taking on Apple both in the United States and Europe over alleged anticompetitive behavior. In the weeks leading up to the verdict, Apple made multiple tweaks to App Store policies in a possible attempt to head off further criticism about its practices. In late August, the company announced a settlement in a class action lawsuit that allows app developers to email their users about alternative payment methods. [CLS] [SEP] Just days later, the company said it will further relax restrictions on "reader" apps — a designation that applies to companies like Spotify and Netflix that distribute media — and allow those apps to link out to external websites for users to set up and manage accounts. That update, which will take effect in 2022, was in response to an investigation by Japan's Fair Trade Commission. [CLS] [SEP] Those changes have received a skeptical reception from the major developers taking on Apple. [CLS] [SEP] "This is a raw demonstration of their monopolistic power: making capricious changes designed to spur good PR for their benefit right as legislation, regulatory scrutiny and developer complaints are closing in on them," a Match Group spokesperson said in response to Apple's class action settlement relaxing email rules for developers. "We hope everyone sees this for what it is — a sham." [CLS] [SEP] Gonzalez Rogers on Friday ordered Apple to change that system, saying the company can no longer prohibit developers from directing users to outside payment mechanisms. [CLS] [SEP] The practical outcome of the 180-page order will likely be that Apple app store developers are no longer required to use Apple's in-app payment system in order to collect funds from iOS users, said Josh Davis, a professor at the University of California at San Francisco law school. He added that Apple will have to be careful with how it implements the order to avoid being in contempt of court after the injunction goes into effect in 90 days. [CLS] [SEP] "They're not just free to characterize this order however they want," he said. [CLS] [SEP] Still, Stanford Law Professor Mark Lemley said it's possible only a few large, well-known apps may benefit from no longer having to rely on Apple's in-app payment system. [CLS] [SEP] "For your ordinary app I'm using, I'm never leaving the app, I'm just using it on the phone," he said. "But it does open the possibility for those that either can persuade you to go or for which you already are going to go [to another platform] ... they can say, 'Hey, go buy your [Fortnite] downloads or your emotes through [the Epic Store].'" [CLS] [SEP] Gonzalez Rogers also ruled in Apple's favor on a counterclaim that Epic was in breach of contract for subverting Apple's in-app payment system and ordered the developer to pay damages equal to 30% of the $12,167,719 in revenue it collected from the iOS Fornite app between August and October 2020, plus 30% of any revenue it earned from the app from November 2020 through the date of the judgment, and interest. [CLS] [SEP] Meanwhile, the pressure on Apple keeps piling up, with the company still facing antitrust scrutiny by the US House and Senate, as well as regulators in the United Kingdom and Europe. [CLS] [SEP] South Korea has already taken one of the most severe actions against Apple's in-app payment restrictions, passing a law in early September that requires Apple and Google to offer alternative payment systems to their users in the country. [CLS] [SEP] Gonzalez Rogers' ruling that Apple has not violated federal antitrust law could increase pressure on US lawmakers to advance proposed bills that would reform antitrust laws for tech giants. [CLS] [SEP] "I would imagine this opinion could add to the momentum behind those bills," UCSF's Davis said, "to the extent that I could imagine legislators saying, 'Wait, we all know Apple has market power. These technicalities of antitrust doctrine are kind of getting in the way. We need to reform the law.'" [CLS] [SEP] Friday's decision is expected to be appealed, and the case could drag on for several months or even years. [CLS] [SEP] Update: This article and headline have been updated to better clarify how Apple has been ordered to ease restrictions on developers.
Brits line up for gas as BP closes some service stations [CLS] [SEP] London (CNN Business)British drivers are being urged not to panic buy gasoline after a shortage of truck drivers forced BP to temporarily close some of its UK service stations. [CLS] [SEP] The Automobile Association (AA) appealed for calm on Friday as drivers in some parts of the United Kingdom flocked to gas stations. [CLS] [SEP] "There is no shortage of fuel and thousands of [stations] are operating normally with just a few suffering temporary supply chain problems," AA President Edmund King told CNN Business. He warned drivers against filling up "outside their normal routines" as "even if the occasional petrol station is temporarily closed, others just down the road will be open." [CLS] [SEP] Yet some Brits paid little heed as the weekend approached, with Shell warning of long lines at stations. [CLS] [SEP] "We are seeing an increased demand today for fuel at some of our stations, which may in some instances result in larger queues. We are adapting our delivery schedules to ensure sufficient supplies for our customers," Shell said in a statement. [CLS] [SEP] Worker shortages are a growing problem in Britain, which had a record 1 million job vacancies between June and August, according to the Office for National Statistics. The shortage of truck drivers has been exacerbated by the pandemic and Brexit, which resulted in tens of thousands of EU nationals leaving their trucking jobs in the United Kingdom. [CLS] [SEP] BP (BP) said in a statement on Thursday that it was "experiencing some fuel supply issues at some of our retail sites in the UK and unfortunately have therefore seen a handful of sites temporarily close due to a lack of both unleaded and diesel grades." [CLS] [SEP] The company blamed "industry-wide driver shortages across the [United Kingdom]" for the supply chain crunch. "We are prioritizing deliveries to motorway service areas, major trunk roads and sites with largest demand and seeking to minimize the duration of stock outs," it added. [CLS] [SEP] BP declined to comment on how many gas stations would be affected, but a person familiar with the situation said that "tens" of sites were experiencing fuel shortages. [CLS] [SEP] UK worker shortages could cancel Christmas. Brexit isn&#39;t helping [CLS] [SEP] UK worker shortages could cancel Christmas. Brexit isn't helping [CLS] [SEP] This is the second time in as many months that BP has had to temporarily shutter some UK locations because of problems distributing fuel due to a lack of truck drivers. According to the Road Haulage Association, the United Kingdom is short around 100,000 truck drivers, 20,000 of whom were EU nationals that left the country after Brexit. [CLS] [SEP] Esso owner ExxonMobil (XOM) said Friday that a "small number" of the 200 fuel stations it operates with supermarket chain Tesco (TSCDF) have also been affected. "We are working closely with all parties in our distribution network to optimize supplies and minimize any inconvenience to customers," the company added in a statement. [CLS] [SEP] The UK government has announced some measures to increase the number of driving tests for truck drivers. But a spokesperson for the government said last month that "most of the solutions" will be driven by industry. [CLS] [SEP] "We want to see employers make long term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labor from abroad and our Plan for Jobs is helping people across the country retrain, build new skills and get back into work," the spokesperson said. [CLS] [SEP] Gas prices in the UK could trigger food shortages within weeks [CLS] [SEP] Gas prices in the UK could trigger food shortages within weeks [CLS] [SEP] However, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps did not rule out issuing short-term visas to EU drivers on Friday. [CLS] [SEP] "I'll look at everything and we'll move heaven and earth to do whatever we can to make sure that shortages are alleviated with HGV [Heavy Goods Vehicle] drivers," he told Sky News in an interview. [CLS] [SEP] It's not just truck drivers. The food and farming sector estimates that there are 500,000 vacancies across the industry, which is leading to food waste because there are insufficient workers to pick, pack, process and transport fresh produce. [CLS] [SEP] Groups representing the food and farming sector on Wednesday called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to implement a "Covid Recovery Visa" to alleviate what they described as "crippling labor shortages across the supply chain." [CLS] [SEP] — Charles Riley and Lauren Gunn contributed reporting.
Why Chevron And Exxon Shun Solar And Wind [CLS] [SEP] Editor OilPrice.com [CLS] [SEP] Mon, September 27, 2021, 12:00 AM·5 min read [CLS] [SEP] In this article: [CLS] [SEP] CVX [CLS] [SEP] +0.19% [CLS] [SEP] Watchlist [CLS] [SEP] Watchlist [CLS] [SEP] Performance Outlookyahoo plus badge [CLS] [SEP] 2W-6W [CLS] [SEP] 6W-9M [CLS] [SEP] 9M+ [CLS] [SEP] XOM [CLS] [SEP] +0.97% [CLS] [SEP] The world's largest oil companies are under growing pressure from shareholders and society to reduce emissions and show efforts to fight the worst effects of climate change. [CLS] [SEP] Everyone in the Big Oil club has announced various plans to cut emissions and invest in low-carbon energy over the past 18 months. Yet, there are stark differences in the ways the largest international oil companies are approaching the emissions problem. [CLS] [SEP] Europe's top oil and gas firms have all committed to becoming net-zero energy businesses by 2050 or sooner. Most of them say their oil production has either peaked already or is about to peak by the middle of this decade. And all of them bet on investments in renewable electricity generation—along with hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, biofuels, and electric vehicle charging networks—to deserve being called 'energy companies' instead of oil companies. [CLS] [SEP] Unlike their European peers, the two supermajors in the United States, ExxonMobil, and Chevron, are not touching solar and wind power. They are more focused on renewable fuels and carbon capture and storage (CCS), both to cut their own carbon footprint and to develop in partnership regional CCS hubs at heavily industrialized areas. [CLS] [SEP] European Oil Majors Bet On Renewables [CLS] [SEP] Together with the net-zero ambitions, all European oil and gas majors—BP, Shell, TotalEnergies, Equinor, Eni, and Repsol—vow increased investment in renewable power generation and low-carbon energy solutions such as hydrogen, CCS, and biofuels. [CLS] [SEP] While hydrogen and CCS still need a lot of development, economies of scale, and major government support to become commercially viable solutions, investment in renewable electricity generation is immediately available for Big Oil. [CLS] [SEP] If they want it, that is. [CLS] [SEP] Europe's majors seem to want it, and almost weekly, they announce projects, investments, or joint ventures to bid in tenders. [CLS] [SEP] Returns in renewables are not as high as in oil and gas, especially these days, with oil prices comfortably sitting at over $70 a barrel and gas prices surging to records for this time of the year. [CLS] [SEP] However, European majors persevere and consider renewables as a key pillar of decarbonization of the global power sector and of reduction of their own emissions from operations. [CLS] [SEP] For example, Equinor wants to be a big name in offshore wind, and Norway's major bid for offshore wind acreage in the major ScotWind leasing round earlier this year. So did BP and Shell. [CLS] [SEP] BP's joint venture Lightsource bp, a solar power developer, announced just this week it would aim to develop 25 GW of solar power by 2025. Since its formation in 2010, Lightsource has developed 3.8 GW of solar projects globally. [CLS] [SEP] "Lightsource bp has developed more than 30 projects, which today have consistently delivered 8 to 10% returns. So when people ask if we really have the capability to deliver the returns we talk about, the answer couldn't be clearer – yes, we can because we are," said Dev Sanyal, BP's executive vice president of gas and low carbon. [CLS] [SEP] Exxon, Chevron Shun Solar And Wind [CLS] [SEP] Across the Atlantic, U.S. supermajors Exxon and Chevron are betting on renewable fuels and CCS, but they are steering clear of investments in solar and wind power generation. [CLS] [SEP] Chevron doesn't have any plans to reduce its oil and gas business to invest in solar or wind power, chief financial officer Pierre Breber said earlier this year. [CLS] [SEP] Shareholder returns are more important for Chevron than investing in wind and solar energy, chief executive Mike Wirth told CNBC in an interview last week. [CLS] [SEP] "These [wind and solar] are technologies that are relatively mature. There is plenty of capital that's available. The returns in wind and solar are actually being bid down, and we've concluded that management in our company can't create value for shareholders by going into wind and solar," Wirth told CNBC. [CLS] [SEP] Chevron Triples Planned Low-Carbon Energy Investment [CLS] [SEP] Days before the interview, Chevron said it would triple its planned capital investment in lower carbon businesses to $10 billion through 2028, including $2 billion to lower the carbon intensity of Chevron's operations. [CLS] [SEP] Chevron's pillars of low carbon energy businesses are growing renewable natural gas production, raising renewable fuels production capacity, boosting hydrogen production, and increasing carbon capture and offsets to 25 million tons per year by developing regional hubs in partnership with others. [CLS] [SEP] "With the anticipated strong cash generation of our base business, we expect to grow our dividend, buy back shares and invest in lower carbon businesses," CEO Wirth said. [CLS] [SEP] ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions – Exxon's New Business [CLS] [SEP] Exxon, for its part, created earlier this year a new business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions, to commercialize its low-carbon technology portfolio, focusing first on CCS. [CLS] [SEP] The new business is advancing plans for more than 20 new CCS opportunities globally to enable large-scale emission reductions. ExxonMobil plans to invest $3 billion on lower-emission energy solutions through 2025. [CLS] [SEP] "We are focused on proprietary projects and commercial partnerships that will have a demonstrably positive impact on our own emissions as well as those from the industrial, power generation and commercial transportation sectors, which together account for 80 percent of global CO2 emissions," Exxon's CEO Darren Woods said in February this year. [CLS] [SEP] Shareholder pressure on Exxon has increased tremendously since then, and so has on Chevron. [CLS] [SEP] The U.S. supermajors have not pledged any net-zero emission targets, but they are likely to accelerate announcements about investments in lower-carbon energy, which, apparently, will not include solar or wind.

Petrobras (PBR) Aims to Obtain Net-Zero Emission From Operations [CLS] [SEP] Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. or Petrobras (PBR Quick QuotePBR - Free Report) announced its commitment to achieve net-zero emissions from operations and work with its partners in non-operated areas to help them lower emissions. [CLS] [SEP] With the rise of Environmental, Social and Governance investing and the broad-based transition toward clean energy; a number of oil/gas companies have decided voluntarily to become carbon neutral over the next three decades. [CLS] [SEP] Petrobras’ decision is part of the strategy of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) member companies, of which Petrobras is a member since 2018. The other OGCI members are BP plc (BP Quick QuoteBP - Free Report) , Chevron Corporation (CVX Quick QuoteCVX - Free Report) , Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A Quick QuoteRDS.A - Free Report) , Aramco, Eni, CNPC, ExxonMobil, Equinor, TotalEnergies, Repsol and Occidental. [CLS] [SEP] Petrobras' net-zero target revolves around scopes 1 and 2 emissions, which involve greenhouse-gas emissions from its operations and indirect emissions associated with energy purchases from third-party suppliers. The target will be achieved in a period consistent with the Paris Climate accords. [CLS] [SEP] OGCI, which constitutes about 30% of the world’s oil and gas production, will work to support the energy industry toward achieving net-zero emissions. The consortium initiated a strategy to boost the energy transition, which aims to lower methane intensity to 0.20% by 2025. [CLS] [SEP] The initiative would reduce the carbon intensity from upstream operations to 17 kg CO2 per barrel of oil equivalent and bring routine flaring to zero by 2030. This could bring an additional reduction of 50 million tons of CO2 equivalent per year by 2025. [CLS] [SEP] According to Petrobras’ recent five-year plan, the company committed to investing $1 billion to reduce its carbon footprint between 2021 and 2025. Over the past 11 years, the company improved its carbon efficiency in upstream activities by 47% and is currently one of the most efficient oil and gas producers in the world. [CLS] [SEP] With the latest initiative, the OGCI members aim to achieve net-zero emissions and progress toward mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change. [CLS] [SEP] Company Profile & Price Performance [CLS] [SEP] Petrobras is the largest integrated energy firm in Brazil and one of the biggest firms in Latin America. Its activities include exploration, exploitation and the production of oil from reservoir wells, shale and other rocks. It comprises refining, processing, trading and transportation of oil and oil products, natural gas, and other fluid hydrocarbons beside other energy-related operations. [CLS] [SEP] Shares of the company have outperformed the industry in the past six months. Its stock has gained 19.1% against the industry’s 13.1% decline.

Will SoFi Technologies Be the Next Fintech Disruptor? [CLS] [SEP] Stocks in the financial technology (fintech) sector have been great performers over the past five years. Square is up more than 2,100%, PayPal has gained almost 600%, and Visa is up nearly 170% in the last five years, with all three beating the returns of the broad S&P 500 index. Clearly there are some great opportunities within the fintech sector for investors to take advantage of. [CLS] [SEP] One new fintech stock to enter the public markets is SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI), which officially started trading this year. Is SoFi the next fintech disruptor set to crush the market? [CLS] [SEP] A bag of money. [CLS] [SEP] IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. [CLS] [SEP] What is SoFi? [CLS] [SEP] SoFi started out a decade ago as a way for people to refinance student loans. It's still in that business, but since then it has expanded its lending offerings to mortgages, consumer loans, and credit cards. Over the last few years, it has expanded into financial services with SoFi Money (a cash account similar to a bank) and SoFi Invest. Its goal is to make the SoFi mobile application a one-stop shop for personal finance needs. The most similar app to SoFi is Square's Cash App, which has payments, deposits, investing, cryptocurrencies, and debit cards. The SoFi app is trying to solve something similar but aims to take its product a step further. [CLS] [SEP] To do this, it is trying to get approved to operate as an official bank under the Federal Reserve System. To speed up that process, it bought a small bank called Golden Pacific Bank to get a bank charter. It is still waiting for regulatory approval to fully start its banking business, but if and when it gets approved, SoFi will have much more flexibility in using customer deposits to finance loans. This will help its lending and financial services segments work in tandem. [CLS] [SEP] Lastly, SoFi owns a technology platform called Galileo that it bought in 2020 for $1.2 billion. Galileo provides application programming interfaces (APIs) and software services to help other companies build digital banking products, easily issue credit cards, and process payments. SoFi's other business units were already customers of Galileo's, and SoFi's management plans to supercharge the company and expand it internationally over the next few years. [CLS] [SEP] Financial Services and Galileo growing quickly [CLS] [SEP] The two most promising parts of SoFi's business right now are financial services and Galileo, mainly because of how fast these segments are growing. [CLS] [SEP] In Q2 of this year, SoFi had 2.6 million financial products being used, up 243% from the same period in 2020 and up from a measly 107,000 in Q1 of 2019. Clearly SoFi has found a product-market fit for its financial services products, including investing, cash management, and cryptocurrencies. Financial services revenue hit $17 million last quarter, up significantly from the $2.4 million in revenue it did in Q2 of last year. With $799 million in revenue over the last 12 months, financial services are a small part of SoFi's business right now -- but could become an even bigger driver of growth over time. [CLS] [SEP] Galileo, the technology platform discussed above, is another highlight of SoFi's business at the moment. The platform now powers 79 million accounts around the globe, up 119% year-over-year in Q2. The segment has seen 100% year-over-year account growth each of the last four quarters, which is a great sign for how SoFi has been able to integrate the recent acquisition. Galileo is a lot larger than financial services, doing $167 million in revenue over the last 12 months and $69 million in contribution profit. For a segment growing users 100% year-over-year, a 41% contribution margin is quite strong. If Galileo can keep up these impressive growth numbers, SoFi's $1.2 billion acquisition price will look like a steal a few years from now because of all the profits Galileo will bring in for the business. [CLS] [SEP] Can SoFi justify its rich valuation? [CLS] [SEP] SoFi's market cap was $13.7 billion at Thursday's market close, giving it a price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 17. Its legacy business, lending, is only growing 14% year over year, which is a bit of a concern for anyone thinking of this as a high-growth investment. However, it looks like this slack will get picked up by the financial services and Galileo segments, since SoFi is guiding for 58% adjusted net revenue (which excludes mark-to-market changes on lending products) this year. And with only 2.56 million members at the end of Q2, it looks like SoFi has a long runway to grow if it can achieve national relevance with its application and broad portfolio of services. So even at this market cap, SoFi could turn into a great investment if it can become a digital financial hub for tens of millions of people around the globe. [CLS] [SEP] The problem is that right now it looks like Square (with Cash App) and PayPal (with its flagship app and Venmo) are eating SoFi's lunch. Those three apps consistently rank one, two, and three in the finance category on Google's and Apple's mobile app stores, while SoFi ranks outside the top 50. Even as fast as SoFi is growing, it is still well behind the big dogs of personal finance right now and has a lot of work left in front of it. For example, Square's Cash App, which offers a lot of similar financial products, like debit cards, investing, and personal loans, grew monthly active users (MAUs) by 10 million over the past 12 months to 40 million, while SoFi has only had 2.56 million people engage with one of its products in its entire company history.  If SoFi can achieve meaningful growth and climb up the app charts, that could be evidence that users view it as a complementary service to Square and PayPal, or that it is making headway against these competitors. [CLS] [SEP] Even though management tells a great story and has a strong product roadmap, I don't believe SoFi Technologies is the next great fintech stock unless it can get close to the usage and download levels of Square and PayPal. That could certainly happen if people get behind SoFi's comprehensive product offering, but right now it looks like it is lagging behind other personal finance apps with product adoption, indicating that the majority of consumers are sticking with the more established fintech apps (Cash App, Venmo, and PayPal) for their personal finance needs at the moment.
Citigroup floats $236.6 million in MBS backing single-family home investors [CLS] [SEP] The Citigroup Mortgage Loan Trust 2021-INV3 is preparing to issue about $236.6 million in mortgage-backed securities, collateralized by conforming, fixed-rate loans made to investors, some of whom are carrying multiple mortgages. [CLS] [SEP] DBRS Morningstar noted that the mortgages are made largely on conforming single-family homes, 65.3%, with another quarter of the mortgages made to two- to four-family homes. [CLS] [SEP] Citigroup Global Markets is the initial note purchaser on the deal, for which Citigroup’s realty corporation is the loan seller and deal sponsor. PennyMac Corp. is acting as the initial seller, originator and servicer, according to DBRS. [CLS] [SEP] The transaction is based on a senior-subordinate, shifting-interest capital structure. [CLS] [SEP] While mortgage payment forbearance plans were common during the COVID-19 induced recession, none of the borrowers in Citigroup Mortgage 2021-INV3’s collateral pool availed themselves of that kind of relief, DBRS said. [CLS] [SEP] The deal features other strengths, according to DBRS, such as high-quality credit attributes such as low loan-to-value ratios, strong borrower credit and full documentation on all of the loans. Borrowers have a weighted average (WA) FICO score of 762, and a 35.1% debt-to-income ratio. [CLS] [SEP] Borrowers are also highly qualified, DBRS said. All borrowers have annual incomes of about $219,377, and about $235,982 in liquid reserves on average. [CLS] [SEP] While the collateral pool contains about 764 conforming loans that either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the government sponsored enterprises (GSE) had screened with their automated underwriting systems, DBRS considers the dominance of investor owners as a challenge to the portfolio. Investment owned properties have a greater risk of default than owner-occupied properties. Also, 25 of the investor borrowers have multiple properties, which accounts for 58 loans, or 7.3% of the pool. [CLS] [SEP] Appraisals on the property collateral were not uniformly rigorous, DBRS suggests, noting that the GSEs have granted appraisal waivers to a moderate amount of loans, 15%. Also, some loans were approved with an exterior-only appraisal at origination, where the home appraiser observes the property from the street. [CLS] [SEP] California accounts for the state with the largest geographic concentration, at 36.6%; followed by Washington, with 5.9% and Arizona, with 5.6%. [CLS] [SEP] DBRS expects to assign ‘AAA’ ratings to most of the notes.

Why Bank of America and Citigroup Are Trading Higher Today [CLS] [SEP] What happened [CLS] [SEP] Shares of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) were trading nearly 4% higher in the final hour of trading Thursday as the broader market rallied from what has been a difficult few weeks. [CLS] [SEP] So what [CLS] [SEP] Like a lot of the market, bank stocks got hit hard on the news about China Evergrande Group (OTC:EGRN.F), and on fears over what the property developer's situation could mean for the Chinese real estate market, which has gotten quite frothy. [CLS] [SEP] The news sent longer-term Treasury yields lower, and bank profits are closely tied to those yields. For that reason, bank stocks have struggled in recent days. However, a recent Bloomberg article revealed that the major U.S. banks do not have any direct lending exposure to Evergrande. [CLS] [SEP] Bank stocks rebounded Thursday as the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bill bounced to 1.41%, the highest it has been since July. Citigroup and Bank of America were slightly outpacing the KBW Bank Index, which tracks large bank stocks. The two also outpaced their giant peers JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). [CLS] [SEP] Bank of America logo on wall. [CLS] [SEP] IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. [CLS] [SEP] Now what [CLS] [SEP] While there was no obvious reason for it, Citigroup and Bank of America seemed to fall harder than their peers earlier this week, perhaps justifying their bigger moves upward Thursday. Citigroup is more of a global bank and has some exposure to China, which may have spooked investors -- not that the other big banks don't have exposure to that market as well. Also, Bank of America's business model makes it more sensitive to interest rate shifts than its peers, which could explain its more volatile moves. [CLS] [SEP] I happen to like both of these banks, especially Citigroup, which I believe could be a great value play to get in on right now.

Moderna CEO Predicts Pandemic Could End in 2022: Here's Why the Stock Could Plunge If He's Right [CLS] [SEP] When will the pandemic be over and life return to normal? Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) CEO Stéphane Bancel thinks it could happen in 2022. In an interview with Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung, Bancel expressed his view that COVID-19 vaccines could help usher in a return to normalcy in the second half of next year. [CLS] [SEP] People across the world will cheer if Bancel's prediction comes true. However, Moderna's shareholders might not join in the celebration. Here's why the vaccine stock could plunge if Bancel is right that the pandemic will be over next year. [CLS] [SEP] A wood block with "normal" printed on it with fingers turning another wood block from 2021 to 2022. [CLS] [SEP] IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. [CLS] [SEP] The probability of declining sales [CLS] [SEP] Moderna expects to rake in $20 billion in sales for its COVID-19 vaccine this year. It could generate similar sales in 2022. But if the pandemic ends in the second half of next year, there's a high probability of declining sales beginning in 2023. [CLS] [SEP] For one thing, Moderna's fortunes thus far have relied upon two doses being given in initial vaccinations. In a post-pandemic world, the best that the company can hope for is for one-shot booster doses to be given on a relatively frequent basis. [CLS] [SEP] Bancel has said in the past that he expects annual boosters will be likely. However, no one knows yet whether or not boosters will be required going forward on an annual basis -- or at all. [CLS] [SEP] There's also a big question about how high vaccination rates will be once the pandemic is over. It wouldn't be surprising if the rates drop when people think that COVID-19 is no longer a significant concern. [CLS] [SEP] Several companies, including Pfizer and Merck, are developing oral COVID-19 pills that could be used for post-exposure prophylaxis. Assuming one or more of these drugmakers are successful, the availability of these pills could make it even less likely that individuals will want to be vaccinated. [CLS] [SEP] A one-trick pony, for now [CLS] [SEP] Moderna's main challenge in this scenario is that the company is a one-trick pony, for now. It doesn't have any other products on the market except its COVID-19 vaccine. Sure, Moderna has quite a few programs in its pipeline. However, none of them are yet in late-stage testing. [CLS] [SEP] The company plans to advance cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine candidate mRNA-1647 into phase 3 clinical studies later this year. But it's going to be a few years before the CMV vaccine might reach the market. [CLS] [SEP] Moderna thinks that mRNA-1647 could generate peak sales of between $2 billion and $5 billion. However, even if the company could somehow magically launch its CMV vaccine in 2023 (which won't happen), it still potentially wouldn't be enough to offset the likely declining sales for its COVID-19 vaccine. [CLS] [SEP] A post-pandemic plunge? [CLS] [SEP] Wall Street is decidedly bearish about Moderna, primarily because of the uncertainty over the company's recurring COVID-19 vaccine sales. One analyst even projects that the stock could fall close to 80%. [CLS] [SEP] However, a post-pandemic plunge for Moderna isn't a sure thing. It's possible that the company could gain market share with higher efficacy than rivals and increase sales with higher prices even as the overall market shrinks. [CLS] [SEP] Remember, too, that investors are always looking to the future. If Moderna's CMV vaccine or any of its other pipeline candidates appear to be especially promising in clinical studies, it could be enough to keep the stock from falling even if COVID-19 vaccine sales begin to decline. [CLS] [SEP] Finally, Moderna has a large and growing cash stockpile. The company could choose to put that cash to use by acquiring or licensing one or more candidates that are close to reaching the market. Such a move could generate enough excitement to overshadow concerns about sliding COVID-19 vaccine sales after the pandemic ends. [CLS] [SEP] Still, there appears to be a very real chance that Moderna stock could pull back significantly when the pandemic is over. Good news for the world might be bad news for this high-flying stock.
US panel backs COVID-19 boosters only for seniors, high-risk [CLS] [SEP] WASHINGTON (AP) — Dealing the White House a stinging setback, a government advisory panel overwhelmingly rejected a plan Friday to give Pfizer COVID-19 booster shots across the board, and instead endorsed the extra vaccine dose only for those who are 65 or older or run a high risk of severe disease. [CLS] [SEP] The twin votes represented a heavy blow to the Biden administration’s sweeping effort, announced a month ago, to shore up nearly all Americans’ protection amid the spread of the highly contagious delta variant. [CLS] [SEP] The nonbinding recommendation — from an influential committee of outside experts who advise the Food and Drug Administration — is not the last word. The FDA will consider the group’s advice and make its own decision, probably within days. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to weigh in next week. [CLS] [SEP] In a surprising turn, the advisory panel rejected, 16-2, boosters for almost everyone. Members cited a lack of safety data on extra doses and also raised doubts about the value of mass boosters, rather than ones targeted to specific groups. [CLS] [SEP] Then, in an 18-0 vote, it endorsed extra shots for people 65 and older and those at risk of serious disease. Panel members also agreed that health workers and others who run a high risk of being exposed to the virus on the job should get boosters, too. [CLS] [SEP] That would help salvage part of the White House’s campaign but would still be a huge step back from the far-reaching proposal to offer third shots of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to Americans eight months after they get their second dose. [CLS] [SEP] The White House sought to frame the action as progress. [CLS] [SEP] “Today was an important step forward in providing better protection to Americans from COVID-19,” said White House spokesman Kevin Munoz. “We stand ready to provide booster shots to eligible Americans once the process concludes at the end of next week.” [CLS] [SEP] The CDC has said it is considering boosters for older people, nursing home residents and front-line health care workers, rather than all adults. [CLS] [SEP] The FDA and CDC will most likely decide at some later point whether people who received the Moderna or Johnson & Johnson shots should get boosters. [CLS] [SEP] During several hours of vigorous debate Friday, members of the panel questioned the value of offering boosters to almost everybody 16 and over. [CLS] [SEP] “I don’t think a booster dose is going to significantly contribute to controlling the pandemic,” said Dr. Cody Meissner of Tufts University. “And I think it’s important that the main message we transmit is that we’ve got to get everyone two doses.” [CLS] [SEP] Dr. Amanda Cohn of the CDC said, “At this moment it is clear that the unvaccinated are driving transmission in the United States.” [CLS] [SEP] In a statement, Kathrin U. Jansen, Pfizer head of vaccine research and development, said the company continues to believe that boosters will be a “critical tool in the ongoing effort to control the spread of this virus.” [CLS] [SEP] Scientists inside and outside the government have been divided recently over the need for boosters and who should get them, and the World Health Organization has strongly objected to rich nations giving a third round of shots when poor countries don’t have enough vaccine for their first. [CLS] [SEP] While research suggests immunity levels in those who have been vaccinated wane over time and boosters can reverse that, the Pfizer vaccine is still highly protective against severe illness and death, even amid the delta variant. [CLS] [SEP] The unexpected turn of events could reinforce criticism that the Biden administration got out ahead of the science in its push for boosters. President Joe Biden promised early on that his administration would “follow the science,” in the wake of disclosures of political meddling in the Trump administration’s coronavirus response. [CLS] [SEP] The FDA panel’s overwhelming initial rejection came despite full-throated arguments about the need for boosters from both Pfizer and health officials from Israel, which began offering boosters to its citizens in July. [CLS] [SEP] Sharon Alroy-Preis of Israel’s Ministry of Health said the booster dose improves protection tenfold against infection in people 60 and older. [CLS] [SEP] “It’s like a fresh vaccine,” bringing protection back to original levels and helping Israel “dampen severe cases in the fourth wave,” she said. [CLS] [SEP] Representatives for Pfizer argued that it is important to start shoring up immunity before protection begins to erode. A company study of 44,000 people showed effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 was 96% two months after the second dose, but had dropped to 84% by around six months. [CLS] [SEP] Both Pfizer and the Israeli representatives faced pushback from panelists. Several were skeptical about the relevance of Israel’s experience to the U.S. Another concern was whether third doses would exacerbate serious side effects, including rare instances of heart inflammation in younger men. [CLS] [SEP] Pfizer pointed to Israeli data from nearly 3 million boosters to suggest side effect rates would be similar to those already reported. [CLS] [SEP] Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said he was supportive of a third dose for adults over 60 or 65, but “I really have trouble” supporting it for anyone down to age 16. [CLS] [SEP] While an extra shot would probably at least temporarily reduce cases with mild or no symptoms, “the question becomes what will be the impact of that on the arc of the pandemic, which may not be all that much,” Offit said. [CLS] [SEP] Biden’s top health advisers, including the heads of the FDA and CDC, first announced plans for widespread booster shots in mid-August, setting the week of Sept. 20 as an all-but-certain start date. But that was before FDA staff scientists had completed their own assessments of the data. [CLS] [SEP] Earlier this week, two top FDA vaccine reviewers joined a group of international scientists in publishing an editorial rejecting the need for boosters in healthy people. The scientists said studies show the shots are working well. [CLS] [SEP] On Friday, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said the Biden administration announcement was not aimed at pressuring regulators to act but was instead an attempt to be transparent with the public and be prepared in the event that boosters won approval. [CLS] [SEP] “We have always said that this initial plan would be contingent on the FDA and the CDC’s independent evaluation,” Murthy said. [CLS] [SEP] The Biden plan has also raised major ethical concerns about impoverished parts of the world still clamoring for vaccine. But the administration argued that the plan was not an us-or-them choice, noting that the U.S. is supplying large quantities of vaccine to the rest of the globe. [CLS] [SEP] The U.S. has already approved Pfizer and Moderna boosters for certain people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients and transplant recipients. [CLS] [SEP] Some Americans, healthy or not, have managed to get boosters, in some cases simply by showing up and asking for a shot. And some health systems already are offering extra doses to high-risk people.

Energy Transfer earnings climb as natgas pipeline revenues jump [CLS] [SEP] NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Energy Transfer LP on Tuesday reported an increase in quarterly net income, driven by gains in its intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage business as well as natural gas liquids unit. [CLS] [SEP] Energy Transfer was among the biggest winners after Winter Storm Uri knocked out power and halted distribution of natural gas in Texas in February. The company had said it expected to gain roughly $2.4 billion due to the storm. [CLS] [SEP] In the second quarter, adjusted earnings in the intrastate transportation segment climbed 20% as the company gained $52 million in transportation fees due to revenues of $39 million related to Winter Storm Uri. [CLS] [SEP] NGL and refined products transportation and services adjusted earnings rose 9.2%. [CLS] [SEP] Energy Transfer said it began service on its Cushing to Nederland expansion project in June, which utilizes a crude oil pipeline previously servicing the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico, the biggest U.S. shale producing region. [CLS] [SEP] The new service provides connectivity to transport crude from the Denver-Julesburg Basin and Cushing, Oklahoma to ET's Nederland, Texas terminal. [CLS] [SEP] "We are now capable of transporting approximately 65,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from the DJ Basin and Cushing area to Nederland, and we are seeing a steady growth in volumes," co-CEO Thomas Long said during the earnings call. [CLS] [SEP] The company is moving forward with a Phase 2 which will increase capacity to 120,000 bpd, expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2022. [CLS] [SEP] In May, a U.S. federal court judge denied a request from Native American tribes to shut the Dakota Access oil pipeline (DAPL). On Tuesday, Energy Transfer said the planned expansion has been placed into service and the system now has capacity of about 750,000 bpd. [CLS] [SEP] For August, nominations on the pipeline system have increased significantly, co-CEO Marshall McCrea said. [CLS] [SEP] Overall net income attributable to partners for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was $626 million, up $273 million from a year earlier. (Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York)

Why Alcoa Stock Is Soaring This Week and May Not Stop [CLS] [SEP] What happened [CLS] [SEP] Shares of aluminum giant Alcoa (NYSE:AA) are racing higher and are up 9.8% so far this week, as of early Friday.  It's a stunning recovery after the stock's steep 16.7% decline just over a week ago. What's with all the volatility? [CLS] [SEP] So what [CLS] [SEP] As a commodity stock, Alcoa shares ebb and flow with commodity prices. Prices of aluminum have fluctuated dramatically in recent days after a heady rally this year, and so has the stock price. [CLS] [SEP] For example, prices in Shanghai hit 13-year highs on Aug. 17 as China -- the world's largest aluminum producer -- curbed production to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Barely two days later, China reported slower than-expected industrial production numbers for June, triggering fears of a meltdown in the global metals and mining market. Prices of key base metals like copper and iron ore tanked, pulling aluminum prices along. [CLS] [SEP] Chances are, Alcoa shares may not have bounced back so fast this week had it not been for a freak fire. [CLS] [SEP] A person working in an aluminum can processing plant. [CLS] [SEP] IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. [CLS] [SEP] On Aug. 22, a major fire broke out at the Jamalco refinery in Jamaica, forcing it to shut down. The incident sent prices of alumina soaring to highs not seen in six months. Alumina is used to produce aluminum. [CLS] [SEP] You may ask: Why does fire at one refinery influence alumina prices so much, and how does it affect Alcoa? [CLS] [SEP] In reality, it isn't about the Jamalco's refinery's size -- it can produce around 1.4 million metric tons of alumina annually, which is only a fraction of the 134.4 million metric tons of alumina produced globally in the past 12 months. [CLS] [SEP] Yet there's already a crunch in supply of the aluminum feedstock, partly because of the COVID-19 pandemic disruptions, so any further drop in production -- whether it's because of curbs in China or a fire at any refinery in the world -- is enough to spook the metal and mining markets. [CLS] [SEP] Alcoa, in particular, stands to benefit the most from higher prices of alumina -- It is the world's largest alumina producer, after all, with a capacity to produce 17 million metric tons a year. Although Alcoa uses much of its produce in its own aluminum smelters, it sells at least half of it externally. [CLS] [SEP] Now what [CLS] [SEP] Alcoa ramped up alumina production to near-record levels last quarter, and I suspect it's continuing to do so to fully exploit the strength in demand and prices. If alumina prices can sustain momentum, Alcoa could deliver yet another record quarter in coming months, which should drive its stock price higher. In any case, I reiterate my views from last week that Alcoa is on solid footing, and it's still too early to call it an end for the commodities supercycle.

Freeport-McMoRan - A Coffer Full Of Copper [CLS] [SEP] Introduction [CLS] [SEP] Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is a pure play copper miner with operations in North America, South America (Peru and Chile), and in Indonesia. FCX’s portfolio of assets includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia, one of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits; and significant mining operations in North America and South America, including the large-scale Morenci minerals district in Arizona and the Cerro Verde operation in Peru. [CLS] [SEP] In a nutshell, I believe that copper is mission-critical for a more electrified world. FCX is well-positioned to capture this demand-driven wave for the 'green metal' from its world-class mines and long-lived reserves. Let FCX speak for themselves below. [CLS] [SEP] Freeport-McMoRan Compelling Investment Case [CLS] [SEP] Source: FCX, 2Q21 Earnings Presentation [CLS] [SEP] Investment thesis [CLS] [SEP] Favorable demand outlook [CLS] [SEP] Anything with electricity requires some degree of copper be it wind turbines, solar panels, electric vehicles or energy storage. The green wave is creating a massive tailwind of demand in the decades to come. I see copper as one of the green metals and a key input factor for the renewable energy market. We all know directionally where that end market is going: up (if you like it or not). [CLS] [SEP] An additional benefit from this 'green tailwind' is the fact that a continued rise in copper demand does not fully hinge on China as was the case in a previous upward cycle for copper. [CLS] [SEP] Supply deficit [CLS] [SEP] It is expected by Goldman Sachs and Woodman that copper will be in a supply deficit as from 2024 onwards and that the 10-year long-term supply gap is the highest in decades now. The mine supply according to their research will peak in 2024E and then slowly decline. Although in the near-term the market looks to be more in balance, it is likely that new mine development will significantly lag the boom in demand from 2025 onward for copper. The lead times for additions to existing mines (~2-4 years) and for new projects (5+ years) indicate that any sufficient supply in the future is hinging on capital allocation decisions now. My sense is that capital allocation to major greenfield copper projects now is not a priority for miners. [CLS] [SEP] Balancing supply and demand with a higher copper price [CLS] [SEP] The traditional response to a supply deficit is that prices will go up to incentivize supply additions. The aforementioned decisions to be made in favor of capital expenditures into (risky) greenfield projects will depend also on the development of the copper price (sustainably at a higher level, in my view, to create the right incentive level). [CLS] [SEP] The current spot copper price is $4.3 per lb and, historically, near all-time highs. [CLS] [SEP] Copper price [CLS] [SEP] Source: Trading Economics [CLS] [SEP] Normally, this would worry me from a 'reversion to the mean' thinking, but 'this time it's different'. [CLS] [SEP] The fundamentals of demand and supply seem to favor a sustained level of copper price or even appreciation of its price. I am not in the forecasting business of copper prices. Luckily, someone else is: Goldman Sachs has a 12-month price expectation for copper at $11,500 per mt (which converts to ~$5.3 per lb) which implies a further ~20% copper price appreciation. [CLS] [SEP] Copper is likely to enter into a next leg up in the pricing cycle. [CLS] [SEP] Organic growth options and long-lived reserves [CLS] [SEP] FCX has a portfolio of internal growth options that it can pursue if it so wishes. I doubt that FCX will venture into too many projects at once, having learned its lessons that a concentrated and controlled expansion is more desirable. [CLS] [SEP] FCX Projects [CLS] [SEP] Source: FCX, 2Q21 Earnings Presentation [CLS] [SEP] These growth options come on top of FCX's existing reserves. These reserves are the estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable reserves using long-term average prices of $2.50/lb for copper and $1,200/oz for gold. [CLS] [SEP] Freeport-McMoRan Existing Reserves [CLS] [SEP] Source: FCX, 2020 Annual Report [CLS] [SEP] Based on FCX's 2022E sales projection, the existing reserves allow for ~26 years of mine life in copper, ~18 years of mine life in gold, and ~46 years of molybdenum. [CLS] [SEP] Freeport-McMoRan Annual Sales Profile [CLS] [SEP] Source: FCX, 2Q21 Earnings Presentation [CLS] [SEP] So FCX can sit still, focus on execution of the current operations, without a need for incremental spending beyond maintenance capex. That is a great position to be in. [CLS] [SEP] Full run rate capacity of Grasberg by year-end 2021 [CLS] [SEP] By the end of 2021, the underground Grasberg mine will be run at full capacity with 2022 being the first full year at this capacity. As of then, there will be material positive volume improvements compared with 2021 in copper and gold. [CLS] [SEP] Freeport-McMoRan Grasberg Underground Advancing on Schedule [CLS] [SEP] Source: FCX, 2Q21 Earnings Presentation [CLS] [SEP] Significant FCF generation [CLS] [SEP] FCX's guidance for operating cash flows (OCF) in 2022E and 2023E is $9.0bn annually based on a copper price of $4.00 per lb. In the 2Q21 earnings presentation, FCX provided its 2021E OCF guidance of $7.5bn. [CLS] [SEP] Freeport-McMoRan EBITDA and Cash Flow at Various Copper Prices [CLS] [SEP] Source: FCX, 2Q21 Earnings Presentation [CLS] [SEP] The increase of OCF into 2022E is driven by the abovementioned ramp up in the Grasberg mine completing by the end of this year. [CLS] [SEP] The capex profile in the near term is also provided. [CLS] [SEP] Freeport-McMoRan Consolidated CapEx [CLS] [SEP] Source: 2Q21 Earnings Presentation [CLS] [SEP] Assuming no working capital movements, in a base case scenario, FCX's free cash flow (FCF) for 2022E and 2023E is $6.5bn annually on a consolidated basis. [CLS] [SEP] I say on a consolidated basis because FCX fully consolidates some joint ventures in which it has operational control: [CLS] [SEP] 1. Grasberg - economic interest of 81.27% through 2022 and 48.76% thereafter; [CLS] [SEP] 2. Cerro Verde - economic interest of 53.56%; and [CLS] [SEP] 3. El Abra - economic interest of 51%. [CLS] [SEP] Note: FCX's Morenci mine is proportionally consolidated for FCX's 72% economic interest so no adjustment is required. [CLS] [SEP] The FCF from these mines are fully consolidated into FCX, and for the FCF attributable to FCX shareholders, we will need to adjust for this as they effectively belong to FCX joint venture partners. [CLS] [SEP] This adjustment process on a FCF basis is quite challenging. For the purpose of simplicity, I have taken a 60% discount on the fully consolidated FCF on a 2023E basis (assuming Grasberg is stepped down in economic interest) which looks conservative to me but still with room for material error. If one were to look at FCX's cash flow statements for 2Q21, it shows dividend payments of which ~45% goes to noncontrolling interests (FCX's joint venture partners) which I used as a starting point. [CLS] [SEP] Knowing this can be materially wrong, I provide a sensitivity to FCX's 2023E FCX based on (i) movements in the copper price and (ii) the adjustment for noncontrolling interests. [CLS] [SEP] FCF attributable to FCX shareholders [CLS] [SEP] Source: Author, FCF attributable to FCX shareholders, sensitivities to copper price and noncontrolling interests assumptions [CLS] [SEP] My conservative stance to a base case scenario for FCX is arriving at $2.6bn of FCF in 2023E with upside risk to rising copper prices and a too conservative noncontrolling interests assumption. [CLS] [SEP] I think the market might be underestimating the impact of noncontrolling interests on FCX's FCF potential since the guidance is explicitly on the fully consolidated operations. One could quickly use the $6.5bn from FCX's implied guidance as the FCF potential but significantly overstate FCX shareholders' entitlement thereof. [CLS] [SEP] Significant capital distributions to shareholders starting 2022 [CLS] [SEP] FCX's financial policy states that up to 50% of FCF will be distributed to shareholders. In the tiny footnote on the slide below, one can see the remark regarding noncontrolling interests and the FCF calculation that I used in the prior section. [CLS] [SEP] Freeport-McMoRan Financial Policy [CLS] [SEP] Source: FCX, 2Q21 Earnings Presentation [CLS] [SEP] Based on the above conservative base case scenario (copper at $4.00 per lb and 60% of FCF to noncontrolling interests), I provide an FCF yield that can serve as the basis for an income strategy from FCX's share. The FCF yield is based on the ~$47.3bn market capitalization of FCX as of the close of business 24 September 2021. [CLS] [SEP] FCX stock - FCF yield, sensitivities to copper price [CLS] [SEP] Source: Author, FCF yield, sensitivities to copper price and noncontrolling interests assumptions [CLS] [SEP] At these assumptions, the up to 50% commitment on FCF distribution from FCX will be a material improvement of FCX's capital distribution. The base dividend of $0.30 per share annually will be topped up with significant pay-outs either through special dividends or share buy-backs. [CLS] [SEP] A decision with regard to the quantum and mix of this capital distribution by FCX will be made following its release of the 2021 results. [CLS] [SEP] Valuation [CLS] [SEP] Based on the 2Q21 position, FCX has an enterprise value (EV) of ~$59.6bn which includes its market capitalization of ~$47.3bn, net debt of $3.4bn and minority interest (or noncontrolling interests) of ~$8.9bn. [CLS] [SEP] The last twelve month (LTM) EBITDA is ~$8.0bn for 2Q21 and the projected EBITDA in 2022E on a copper price of $4.00 per lb is $12.5bn. This implies an EV/EBITDA of 7.5x for a 2Q21 LTM basis and an EV/EBITDA of 4.8x for 2022E. [CLS] [SEP] Together with the 5.5% FCF yield for 2023E (higher in 2022E due to the ownership stepdown as of 2023 in Grasberg) which will translate to potentially in material dividends to shareholders, the valuation is not stretched by any means. [CLS] [SEP] Risk Factors [CLS] [SEP] The biggest impact risk I see for FCX is the country risk of their operations outside the United States. Changes in political leadership and less stability always will create a degree of risk that is hard to factor in explicitly. [CLS] [SEP] In Peru, discussion now centers more around potential taxes that miners would be due. Involving the IMF is a sensible approach in my view. If material higher taxes are due by the miners, this can be a negative impact in the short term. [CLS] [SEP] In Chile, in the wake of recent civil unrest, there is increased pressure to curb miners or to extract further royalties in case of rising copper prices. [CLS] [SEP] In Indonesia, FCX has cemented its relationship with the Indonesian government a few years ago. It will still continue solid navigation in a potentially volatile environment, for example, the FCX commitment to build a smelter in Indonesia. [CLS] [SEP] FCX Indonesian smelter update [CLS] [SEP] Source: FCX, 2Q21 Earnings Presentation [CLS] [SEP] Let's not forget the usual macro risks that exist such as China / Evergrande, inflation and higher interest rates, growth expectations, income disparity, politics, unknown unknowns, etc. There is always something to worry about! [CLS] [SEP] Conclusion [CLS] [SEP] There are many reasons to be invested in copper and FCX in my view. Copper is the metal that supports the green and renewable energy initiatives. There is not enough supply for the future demand which is likely to increase copper prices further. [CLS] [SEP] FCX has an enviable position. It has reached near-stability in all its mines with organic growth options not requiring new greenfield investments. Moderately valued at 4.8x EV/EBITDA 2022E and at 5.5% FCF yield 2023E based on a copper price of $4.00 per lb and a 60% attribution of FCF to noncontrolling interests. [CLS] [SEP] This all leaves upside risk. At $5.00 per lb copper price, the FCF yield in 2023E would be 8.3%. I am a go on FCX.
Cleveland-Cliffs Sticks to ‘Self Sufficiency’ Model [CLS] [SEP] Lourenco Goncalves, CEO of Cleveland-Cliffs  (CLF) - Get Cleveland-Cliffs Inc Report, recently discussed  the steelmaker’s share price recovery  --  about 800% -- over the past 18 months with  "Mad Money’s" Jim Cramer. [CLS] [SEP] At the start of the pandemic in March 2020 , Cleveland-Cliffs stock tumbled to a low of $3.14 per share. The stock has been trading in the $24 range recently. [CLS] [SEP] As Goncalves explained to Cramer on Mad Money, see the recap here, the company has stuck to its strategy of being a leader in many categories in the steel business.  Check out how you can profit from the investment ideas on Real Money. [CLS] [SEP] Cleveland-Cliffs is a fully integrated and self-sufficient steel producer. The firm has its hands in everything from digging the ore out of the ground to pelletizing of iron ore to stamping out parts made from completed steel. [CLS] [SEP] Cleveland-Cliffs is now the largest flat-rolled steel company and the largest iron ore pellet producer in the U.S. and in North America, holding an industry-leading market position in automotive steel, according to the company’s website. [CLS] [SEP] Goncalves argues that steel continues to be the backbone of the new economy even as it was with the old economy. [CLS] [SEP] Goncalves added that Cleveland-Cliffs remains focused on their customers with an eye on running a profitable business that makes money for its shareholders. Together, they're envisioning the future. [CLS] [SEP] When asked about their environmental initiatives, Goncalves said that Cleveland-Cliffs is the cleanest steel producer in the world and operates some of the most modern facilities. [CLS] [SEP] To be sure, the company has also drawn attention as a meme stock play on Wall Street from traders hoping to leverage a short squeeze on the stock. [CLS] [SEP] Cleveland-Cliffs has also made headlines with its financial incentives to employees who choose to get the COVID-19 vaccine [CLS] [SEP] Goncalves told Cramer 75% of the company’s employees are now vaccinated. At crucial plants such as Indiana Harbor and a new facility in Toledo, Ohio, the rate is even higher, at 78% and 81%, respectively, he said. [CLS] [SEP] Cleveland-Cliffs announced its intention to give a $1,500 bonus to workers who received the Covid vaccine in July. At that time, 35% of the company’s employees were vaccinated, according to a release.
US Steel Output Spikes 20% YTD on Higher Capacity, Solid Demand [CLS] [SEP] U.S. raw steel production edged down on a weekly comparison basis for the week ending Sep 4 as lower production across Southern and Midwest offset gains in North East and Great Lakes. Capacity utilization — a key metric in the steel industry — remained close to the 85% level amid strong domestic demand. [CLS] [SEP] According to the latest American Iron and Steel Institute ("AISI") weekly report, domestic raw steel production was 1,866,000 net tons for the week ending Sep 4, a 0.4% decrease from production of 1,873,000 net tons for the week ending Aug 28. [CLS] [SEP] Notwithstanding the modest weak-on-weak decline, U.S. steel output remains higher than at the same time last year when shutdowns across major steel-consuming sectors due to the coronavirus pandemic put a crimp on steel demand. Per AISI, output for the reported week represents a 23.5% rise from production of 1,511,000 for the same period a year ago. Domestic steel production is also up roughly 20% so far this year. [CLS] [SEP] Capacity Utilization Remains Near 85% [CLS] [SEP] Capacity utilization was 84.5% for the reported week, inching down from the previous week’s reading of 84.9%. Capability utilization rate for the reported week was significantly up from 67.4% a year ago, according to AISI. [CLS] [SEP] Capacity utilization rate plummeted to 51.1% in May 2020 — the lowest level in many years — after remaining above the important 80% (the minimum rate required for sustained profitability of the steel industry) level in early 2020 as the pandemic gutted steel demand across major end markets. Utilization started to improve with a rebound in demand from the slump witnessed during the first half of 2020. U.S. steel production has also picked up on an uptick in capacity utilization. [CLS] [SEP] Meanwhile, adjusted year-to-date production through Sep 4 was 63,904,000 net tons at a capability utilization rate of 80.6%, up 20.1% from 53,230,000 net tons registered in the same period a year ago, AISI noted. Capability utilization rate for the period is also up from 66.6% recorded last year. [CLS] [SEP] By regions, production from Great Lakes rose roughly 1.9% on a weekly basis to 650,000 net tons in the reported week. North East saw a roughly 16.4% increase in production to 177,000 net tons for the reported week. Production in the Southern region slipped roughly 4.9% to 771,000 net tons. Mills in the Midwest region produced 193,000 net tons of raw steel, down around 2.5% from a week ago. Production rose roughly 1.4% in the Western region to 75,000 net tons. [CLS] [SEP] U.S. Steel Industry Riding on Zooming Prices, Strong Demand [CLS] [SEP] The U.S. steel industry came roaring back in 2021 after bearing the brunt of the pandemic last year, thanks to a strong revival in domestic demand and skyrocketing steel prices. [CLS] [SEP] Coronavirus hurt demand for steel across major end-use markets such as construction and automotive during the first half of 2020. The pandemic-led demand destruction also forced U.S. steel mills to curtail production with capacity utilization dropping to a multi-year low during the first half. The coronavirus-induced shutdowns in the North American automotive industry contributed to the production cuts amid a slump in steel demand. [CLS] [SEP] However, the domestic steel industry has bounced back strongly on zooming steel prices and strong pent-up demand. Demand for steel started to pick up from the third quarter last year with the resumption of operations across major steel-consuming sectors, following the loosening of restrictions. [CLS] [SEP] American steel makers are seeing healthy order booking in automotive, notwithstanding the semiconductor crunch. Demand in the non-residential construction market also remains resilient. [CLS] [SEP] The demand rebound has contributed to the significant uptick in U.S. steel industry capacity utilization on the restart of idled capacity. U.S. steel prices are also on an upswing, driven by an upturn in demand and supply shortages partly due to the pandemic. [CLS] [SEP] The benchmark hot-rolled coil (“HRC”) prices plunged to a pandemic-led multi-year low of roughly $440 per short ton in August 2020. However, HRC prices started to recover from September 2020 and are shooting higher since then on U.S. steel mills’ price hike actions, tight supply conditions, lower steel imports and solid demand. Prices have cruised above the $1,900 per short ton level as the bull run continues. HRC prices have shot up more than four-fold from the August 2020 low. [CLS] [SEP] The imbalance between supply and demand has largely contributed to the strong run-up in steel prices. The price rally is expected to continue in the coming months on higher demand and supply constraints, which is likely to be exacerbated by a series of planned mill outages and scheduled maintenance. [CLS] [SEP] Robust domestic demand and the price surge helped U.S. steel companies deliver strong results in the second quarter. Domestic steel mills are benefiting from spread expansion as a significant spurt in HRC prices has more than offset higher ferrous scrap costs. Higher demand and a favorable pricing environment are likely to help U.S. steel producers to continue the momentum in the third quarter.

Mining Firm Responsible for 270-Death Disaster Behind New Canada Fiasco [CLS] [SEP] After two grueling days trapped underground, most of the 39 workers stuck in a mine in the Canadian city of Sudbury finally climbed to the surface on Tuesday. The grueling rescue operation began after an elevator accident left workers stranded almost 4,000 feet below ground—that’s four times the height of the Eiffel Tower. [CLS] [SEP] While the rest of the workers are expected to escape unharmed, previous employees for the Brazilian firm Vale, which owns the Canadian Totten mine in Sudbury, were not as lucky. [CLS] [SEP] On Jan. 25, 2019, a catastrophic mining dam collapse in Brumadinho, Brazil killed at least 270 people, mostly Vale employees. The collapse unleashed tons of waste into neighboring areas, engulfing nearby offices, farms, and a country house. The accident is considered one of the deadliest mining disasters in history, leading to $7 billion in compensation to victims affected by the tragedy as well as murder charges against 16 officials, including Vale executives, who had disregarded years of safety complaints about the dam, according to an investigation by an independent commission. [CLS] [SEP] That’s not all. Vale has been plagued by a string of smaller, albeit deadly, incidents in the past decade, in both Canada and Brazil. A collapse at a dam operated by the company in 2015 in the Brazilian town of Mariana killed 19 people, including a 5-year-old boy. Two workers in another Vale-owned mine in the same Canadian city of Sudbury were crushed to death in 2011. That was before another Sudbury Vale worker was killed in 2012. The list goes on. [CLS] [SEP] Through it all, Vale has maintained its commitment to the safety of its over 120,000 employees worldwide. [CLS] [SEP] “We have been in frequent communication with [our workers] since the incident. There are no reports of injuries and they have had and continue to have access to water and food... Rescuing our employees safely and in a timely manner is our number one priority,” read a Monday statement from the company addressing the latest Sudbury incident.

Macy’s And Kohl’s Define Post-Pandemic Department Stores’ Look [CLS] [SEP] Department stores of the future will operate with tighter inventories, speedy delivery and a host of merchandise partners. They will be profitable and will concentrate on developing smaller selling units. [CLS] [SEP] Last week Macy’s and Kohl’s reported sales and earnings for the second quarter of 2021. Sales and earnings for both companies were above expectations, and the companies dutifully raised their sales and earnings expectations for the rest of the fiscal year. Their enthusiasm is justified. Things are more normal and even women’s dresses are selling at a better pace. The back-to-school business has been generating strong demand for children’s clothing and adult apparel, suggesting that the third quarter of the current year had a strong start despite the fact that the Delta variant of the coronavirus has rekindled fear among consumers. [CLS] [SEP] All retail companies were complaining about delays in their supply lines and cost of transportation. There were delays at ports and lack of available of container ships. Obviously, there were steep cost increases and delays on overland trucking. It all adds to increased operating costs that haves to be passed on to the consumer – in other words, inflationary pressures are forcing retail prices to be higher. But, clearly, pent up demand motivated consumers to still shop. [CLS] [SEP] More Partnerships Help Sustain Growth [CLS] [SEP] Macy’s – One of the most important announcements Macy’s made during the conference call last Thursday was the fact that the company has partnered with Toys “R’ Us to be in more than 400 stores for this holiday season. Toys “R” Us will be available in all stores next year. The brand is on-line right now. The Toys “R” Us brand is well known, and the expertise of seasoned toy merchants will serve the Macy’s customer well. Geoffrey the Giraffe will be greeting children in the toy department. (The company was founded by Charles Lazarus in 1957. Recently, Toys “R” Us was liquidated and the brand is now owned by WHP Global Partners). [CLS] [SEP] It Is important to note that toys are bought in the “locker stock”, merchandise is withdrawn from locker stock when a customer buy the toy. Toy sales and toy inventory will have to be paid on the 10th of January of the year following the selling season. I am excited that Macy’s has made a partnership with WHP Global to insure a full assortment early and throughout the holiday season.

In addition, trained sales associates that know their products in depth make customers more comfortable in their purchases. [CLS] [SEP] Kohl’s – Michelle Gass, CEO and President, is very excited about the opening of Sephora shops in Kohl’s stores. 70 units were opened last Friday and there will be 200 open by the end of the year and about 850 shop-in-shops by the time 2023 closes. The three stores that opened Sephora shops earlier this month gave management the optimism of a successful partnership that will bring young customers to the Kohl’s stores. While Kohl’s management tried to upgrade the cosmetic departments in the past with new fragrances and other beauty items, this partnership brings Sephora’s trained sales people to assist customers in their selection. It is a win for Kohl’s and it joins other Kohl’s partnerships like Lands’ End, Eddie Bauer, Cole Haan, and Champion. [CLS] [SEP] Kohl’s has shifted to selling young action-wear national brands like Nike NKE -1.9%, Under Armour UAA -0.2%, Champion, and Vans. The current focus on denims from Levi and Lauren Conrad reflects heightened attention to brands that appeal to younger customers. Management has indicated that they are striving to have 30% of their sales in action-wear brands. [CLS] [SEP] Conclusion: European department stores have many departments that are operated by fashion brands. Some major stores like Galeries Lafayette have more than 60% of their store owned and operated by fashion leaders like Dior, Gucci, and Yves St. Laurent. That is not the case in the United States. While there are some partnerships, it is less than 10% in most stores. Sure, Macy’s raised the bar by having a Toy’s “R” Us operation in most of the stores by next year. I think that relationship will be very successful. There are many others – Armani in Bloomingdale’s, Gucci in Macy’s Herald Square, and Nordstrom’s JWN -1.2% that has relationships with Top Shop, Indochine and Jerry Lorenzo. [CLS] [SEP] As we come out of the pandemic, we will see more partnerships that will highlight designers and expert merchants. The need for these talented people to be part of the retail scene revives excitement, expertise and well-timed fashion savvy. [CLS] [SEP] N.B. Macy’s reported in their second quarter 2021 a +61.2 % increase in comparable owned sales. Earnings per diluted shares rose from a loss of ($1.39) to $1.08.

What’s Next For Macy’s Stock After An 8% Move Last Week? [CLS] [SEP] Macy’s stock (NYSE: M), a department store chain, increased by 8% in the last five trading days (one week). In comparison, the broader S&P500 index grew marginally over the same period. The company announced its plans to hire 76,000 employees for the upcoming holiday season, with approximately 37% of these new hires in permanent positions. Last year, about 6,800 seasonal workers remained with the company after holiday hiring in 2020. That said, the market reacted upward to this news probably because Macy’s M +3.2% has fewer stores this year than in previous years, and yet they are hiring roughly the same amount of people for this holiday season. By the look of things, the company looks well-positioned to mitigate supply chain issues heading into the back half of the fiscal year. [CLS] [SEP] Macy’s saw a stellar fiscal second-quarter after beating revenue and earnings expectations. The retailer’s sales increased 2% to $5.65 billion and adjusted earnings per share more than quadrupled to $1.29 compared to the fiscal 2019 quarter. To add to this, the company’s comparable sales increased 5.9% relative to the second quarter of 2019. It should be noted that Macy’s expenses remained well below the 2019 levels, due to store closures, cost-cutting measures, and temporary under-staffing related to the tight labor market. Looking ahead, the company continues to expect significant earnings growth in Q3 as well, with adjusted EPS of $0.17 to $0.26, up from $0.07 in Q3 2019. However, it also estimates Q3 sales to come in between $5.04 billion and $5.19 billion, compared to $5.17 billion two years ago. This forecast implies a sequential slowdown in growth, most likely due to the recent surge in Covid-19 cases associated with the Delta variant. [CLS] [SEP] Now, is M stock poised to grow?

Alibaba stock tumbles after report says Beijing wants to break up Alipay [CLS] [SEP] Hong Kong (CNN Business)Shares in Alibaba slumped again on Monday after the Financial Times reported that Beijing is planning to break up Alipay, the hugely popular payment app owned by its financial affiliate, Ant Group. [CLS] [SEP] But that wasn't the only piece of news that led to the stock's decline. Investors are also concerned that Beijing is intensifying its ongoing crackdown on big tech, after regulators ordered internet firms — including Alibaba and Tencent — to stop blocking rivals' links on their platforms. [CLS] [SEP] Alibaba (BABA) fell as much as 7% in Hong Kong, before trimming losses to 4.2% at the close. The stock has shed 46% since early November 2020, when Chinese regulators halted Ant Group's giant IPO at the last minute, erasing about $380 billion off Alibaba's market value. Ant Group was spun off from Jack Ma's Alibaba in 2011. Alibaba still owns a third of the fintech company. [CLS] [SEP] Since yanking its IPO, regulators have already ordered Ant to restructure as a financial holding company, and now its superapp —Alipay —may be next in line. According to the Financial Times, China wants to break up Alipay and create a separate app for its loans business. [CLS] [SEP] "Chinese regulators have already ordered Ant to separate the back end of its two lending businesses, Huabei, which is similar to a traditional credit card, and Jiebei, which makes small unsecured loans, from the rest of its financial offerings and bring in outside shareholders," the paper said. [CLS] [SEP] "Now officials want the two businesses to be split into an independent app as well," it added, citing unnamed sources. [CLS] [SEP] The regulators also want Ant to turn over the user data that underpins its lending decisions to a new credit scoring joint venture that will be partly state-owned, the report said. [CLS] [SEP] Ant and the People's Bank of China didn't immediately reply to a request for comment. [CLS] [SEP] Alipay, the digital payments app, boasts of more than 700 million active users every month. But while it has grown unchecked over the past decade, authorities are becoming increasingly mindful of how much influence the tech industry has on the country's economy. Ant, for example, controls more than half of the mobile payments market in China. [CLS] [SEP] No more blocking [CLS] [SEP] On Monday, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology ordered the country's internet firms to end a long-standing practice of blocking rivals' links on their platforms. The ministry said it will punish those who did not correct their actions within an unspecified deadline. It didn't specify the punishments. [CLS] [SEP] The comments made at a press conference came after a state-owned newspaper reported on Saturday that the ministry met with a handful of internet companies late last week to discuss the issue. [CLS] [SEP] Apart from Alibaba, other Chinese tech stocks also dropped sharply, following the comments by the ministry. Meituan lost 4.5%, and Tencent (TCEHY) fell 2.4%.

Why JD.com Is My Top Chinese E-Commerce Stock [CLS] [SEP] There are a lot of options for investors to choose from in Chinese e-commerce. [CLS] [SEP] In this Backstage Pass segment recorded on Aug. 23, Fool contributors Jeremy Bowman and Brian Withers explain why JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is their favorite in the sector. Among JD's assets are its vast logistics network, innovative technology, and its push into new industries like telehealth and supermarkets. [CLS] [SEP] Jeremy Bowman: I think my favorite of the three for a while has been JD.com. I like what they are doing a lot in logistics. I think they are building out a lot of the competitive advantages that we've seen with Amazon as far as logistics. They started off doing first-party. They're adding more marketplace sales. They can provide logistics services as well. I like the way they are moving into healthcare with an online pharmacy. I think they are doing some telehealth things, which is pretty cool. They've added on groceries. They started off as mostly selling electronics and appliances, and they've really branched out from there. I think they have a lot of optionality and growth opportunities. [CLS] [SEP] Brian Withers: Yeah. I forgot to mention that too, Jeremy. You brought up a great point is they are the largest grocer in China. They have a massive grocery business as well. With 1,200 warehouses around the country, I think they are better positioned than anyone to capture that business, and that's an absolutely great business from a regular purchase standpoint and getting people hooked on your platform, as long as you deliver high-quality products that get delivered in a timely fashion. I'm with you. I like JD.com. I never really liked Alibaba from the beginning. One, I think it went public at $100 billion market cap. Part of it is they were already huge and they were facilitating a massive amounts of sales. I normally would like the third-party model, Sea Limited and MercadoLibre play in that space, but I geek out on the tech with these guys and I think they are doing a lot of neat things and have really established their investments over the last five years plus. Have really put them in a tremendous position to continue to grow profitably over time. Now, you'll see quarters like this one where, this is not unlike Amazon, which would one quarter invest a bunch of money and then they would barely eke out a profit, and then the next quarter, they wouldn't, and they'd post really great profits. This is not unprecedented in what's going on. If you're interested in e-commerce in China, you ought to look up JD, and I think you have to be patient.
Why Vipshop Stock Crashed (Further) Today [CLS] [SEP] What happened [CLS] [SEP] Shares of Vipshop Holdings (NYSE:VIPS) slumped again on Thursday, losing as much as 10.6% before recovering some of its losses. As of 2:21 p.m. EDT, the stock was down 5.3%. [CLS] [SEP] The Chinese e-commerce company plunged anew after a Wall Street analyst posited that its immediate future looks bleak. [CLS] [SEP] Couple lounging on a couch looking at a tablet. [CLS] [SEP] IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. [CLS] [SEP] So what [CLS] [SEP] Vipshop has had a rough year thus far and the bad times could continue. So says J.P. Morgan analyst Andre Chang, who downgraded the stock from overweight (buy) to neutral (hold), while slashing its price target in half, from $22 to $11, according to a report by The Fly. [CLS] [SEP] It's important to note that the stock has already lost nearly 74% of its value since hitting a new all-time high earlier this year. Chang believes that even after this rout, Vipshop stock could have further to fall in the coming months, as challenges remain for the online retailer. The analyst is forecasting revenue growth of just 5% year over year in the second half, with margins plunging even further. [CLS] [SEP] Several issues are feeding this bearish view. Chang says the "macro environment cool-down" that hit sales was worse than originally anticipated. Vipshop relies heavily on the sale of consumer discretionary and discount items for much of its business, and these sales were among the hardest hit. This has led to concerns about the sustainability of its user engagement. Additionally, Vipshop hasn't scaled back very much on its sales and marketing expenses, leading Chang to conclude that margins will be hit hard, at least over the short term. [CLS] [SEP] Now what [CLS] [SEP] Investors should keep in mind that Vipshop has been extremely volatile. In the three years following its initial public offering in 2012, the stock surged to $30, gaining more than 5,000%. It spent the next three years falling, plunging to less than $5 per share, before rocketing to more than $45 per share earlier this year. [CLS] [SEP] If the pandemic has illustrated anything, it's that e-commerce isn't going anywhere. For investors who are sold on Vipshop's discount online retail strategy, this is just another bump in the long road ahead.
Cisco Exec Riffs On Global 5G Core Delays [CLS] [SEP] A 5G standalone (SA) core, more than anything else, defines what is and isn’t true 5G, and deployments remain astonishingly rare globally. [CLS] [SEP] Multiple factors have thus far precluded an abundance of 5G cores, including technical, financial, and readiness, according to Cisco EVP Jonathan Davidson. [CLS] [SEP] Because most operators initially deployed 5G on a non-standalone (NSA) core anchored to 4G LTE, engineers are left no choice but to manage and operate networks, at least temporarily, running on 4G LTE, 5G NSA, and 5G SA. And that’s complicated, the GM of Cisco’s Mass-Scale Infrastructure Group, explained in a phone interview. [CLS] [SEP] “If you were to look at the call flows for how you do handoffs from 4G to 5G NSA to 5G SA, the control plane complexity is really high. And a lot of [operators] are putting in different cores, and so the handoffs are challenging,” he said. [CLS] [SEP] Signaling issues become less troublesome in a converged core — an effort that will help but take more time to realize. “I think that will help, but still you have to upgrade to that converged core, and that’s not as simple as upgrading your iPhone. It’s critical infrastructure,” Davidson said.

Learn how and why you should optimize. [CLS] [SEP] DOWNLOAD [CLS] [SEP] Cisco Flexes T-Mobile’s Flagship 5G SA [CLS] [SEP] T-Mobile US, with assistance from Cisco, Ericsson, and Nokia, activated the world’s first 5G SA network operating on a 5G core in August 2020. It remains the only nationwide carrier to achieve that feat. [CLS] [SEP] Some operators are still waiting for selected vendors to deliver commercial-ready technology. “There’s a number of vendors who over-promised,” Davidson said. [CLS] [SEP] Readiness must also be achieved in-house because 5G SA introduces a new mode of operation. “This is very different than how critical infrastructure has been done in the past,” he said. “It’s much more real time and that’s great.” [CLS] [SEP] One of Cisco’s 5G SA customers receives new code from Cisco twice a week and it’s deployed in the operator’s production network a day or two later, according to Davidson. [CLS] [SEP] “I always viewed 5G as really an excuse to change the operating model for moving to software. We knew this big architectural shift was happening” he said. “So, jointly with our customers, why don’t we use this as an opportunity to fundamentally change how infrastructure is deployed, managed, and operated?” [CLS] [SEP] ‘Pure 5G as It Was Meant To Be’ [CLS] [SEP] What makes 5G SA important? “It’s true 5G,” Davidson said. “It’s the promise of 5G. It’s not a hybrid where you still have to use some of the old 4G parts to make the 5G work. This is pure 5G as it was meant to be.” [CLS] [SEP] Operators gain many of the benefits expected with 5G once they transition to 5G SA, he added. A 5G core unlocks the potential for new services, including massive IoT, fixed wireless access, and network slicing, or what Davidson refers to as segmentation. [CLS] [SEP] “Moving to a more software-defined future with 5G SA means that you can go and dynamically offer different levels of service-level agreements for applications, for user groups, and things of that nature,” he explained. [CLS] [SEP] 5G Core Revenues Plummet Amid Operator Indecisiveness [CLS] [SEP] The slow uptake of 5G mobile cores globally is also showing up in vendors’ 5G core revenues, according to a recent Dell’Oro Group report. The mobile core network market slowed to 6% year-over-year growth in the second quarter of 2021, following four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. [CLS] [SEP] 5G core market growth is now forecast to decelerate through the next four quarters, dropping to 17% year-over-year growth in the second quarter of 2022. Operator indecisiveness is largely to blame, according to David Bolan, research director at Dell’Oro Group. [CLS] [SEP] “Communications service providers  (CSPs) need to make decisions about which direction to take for 5G SA deployments. CSPs have several options to mull over, with new choices that were not available during the switch from 3G to 4G,” he wrote. [CLS] [SEP] “One decision CSPs need to make is about the selection of NFVi. NFVi can be procured from a 5G core vendor, a third party, the public cloud, or another platform,” Bolan added. [CLS] [SEP] Indeed, the ongoing disaggregation of hardware and software creates complexity for operators in both how and who they choose to help run their 5G cores. Davidson pointed to the access and mobility management function (AMF) as one area where framework choices that impact the 5G core must be made. Most of the early 5G SA operators placed AMF with the radio vendors, but others plan to house AMF with a mobile core vendor, he said.

Uber to benefit from a government takeover of Didi given its more than $5 billion stake, analyst says [CLS] [SEP] Shares of Uber Technologies Inc. UBER, -2.69% rose 0.5% in premarket trading Friday, as the ride-sharing company was set to benefit from a potential investment in China-based rival Didi Global Inc. DIDI, -3.16% by China's government, according to Gordon Haskett analyst Robert Mollins. Didi's stock jumped 4.8% ahead of Friday's open after Bloomberg reported that China had proposed making an investment. Uber has disclosed that it owned about $6.3 billion worth of Didi's stock at the end of 2020, and said it sold $207 million worth of its investment in January and had agreed to sell another $293 million worth of Didi shares in the first half of 2021. "If the Bloomberg article proves to be true, we see this as a positive for Uber," Gordon Haskett's Mollins wrote in a note to clients. "Uber has been very upfront about wanting to monetize its stake in Didi and we see a transaction with Beijing as a way to sell a ~$5B stake in the company without driving Didi's share price down as a result of selling on the open market." Uber's stock has dropped 15.0% over the past three months through Thursday while the S&P 500 SPX, -2.04% has gained 8.2%.
Does Didi's crash point to the future of U.S.-China financial frictions? [CLS] [SEP] Didi Global Inc., China’s largest ride-hailing app operator, went public on the New York Stock Exchange on June 30, pricing its initial public offering at the top of its range at $14 (¥1,540), meaning its total market value would reach some ¥8 trillion. [CLS] [SEP] It is not surprising that the market welcomed the debut, considering the company’s rapid growth in the roughly nine years after its launch, making full use of artificial intelligence and data systems as its business strategy. [CLS] [SEP] But shock waves hit the market only a few days later. Didi shares fell as much as 25% compared to the closing price from the previous week, after Chinese regulators on July 4 ordered app stores to remove the company’s app, citing serious legal violations regarding its collection and usage of personal information, and the Chinese government announced on July 6 it would tighten oversight of companies listed overseas. [CLS] [SEP] The Didi crash, along with the suspension of the Chinese fintech giant Ant Group’s listing — dubbed the largest listing in a century — on the Nasdaq-style STAR Market in Shanghai and also in Hong Kong in November, made Wall Street investors worry about where the financial friction between the United States and China will lead. [CLS] [SEP] ‘Chimerica’ structure [CLS] [SEP] Although the United States and China are said by some to be in the midst of a “new Cold War,” financial businesses linking the two nations are, ironically, thriving. [CLS] [SEP] According to the Nikkei business daily, the U.S.’ securities investments in China total some $1.2 trillion (¥130 trillion), of which 75% is invested in stocks. [CLS] [SEP] China’s securities investments in the U.S. total about $2.1 trillion (¥230 trillion), more than that of the U.S. in China. More than 90% of the investment is made in U.S. Treasury bonds, making China the second largest foreign holder of such bonds after Japan. [CLS] [SEP] A trader works during the IPO for Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Global Inc. on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on June 30. | REUTERS [CLS] [SEP] A trader works during the IPO for Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Global Inc. on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on June 30. | REUTERS [CLS] [SEP] China’s huge financial business is supported by major U.S. financial institutions which are eager to get a share of the profits driven by the rapidly growing Chinese financial market. [CLS] [SEP] Seemingly quite unconcerned about the New Cold War, they are intently expanding personnel in mainland China and Hong Kong. [CLS] [SEP] In May, Goldman Sachs Asset Management set up a wealth management firm jointly with China’s largest bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), with Goldman Sachs offering a 51% funding contribution ratio and ICBC 49%. [CLS] [SEP] The news attracted global attention, being a joint venture between a top global money-making investment bank and a commercial bank with the largest amount of funds in the world. [CLS] [SEP] While Wall Street is said to be leaning toward the Democratic Party, which maintains a harsh stance against China, the U.S. and Chinese financial industries have continued to complement each other, maintaining what some have dubbed a “Chimerica” relationship, being joined at the hip. [CLS] [SEP] Data sovereignty [CLS] [SEP] There are two issues to focus on regarding the financial conflict between the U.S. and China. [CLS] [SEP] One is the issue of Chinese firms listing their shares in the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] Currently, there are some 200 China concept stocks — shares of companies that operate in mainland China — listed in the U.S., with their total market value topping $2 trillion. [CLS] [SEP] Chinese companies that first started listing their shares in the New York Stock Exchange in the mid-1990s were mainly state-owned firms, but recently more private companies have been getting listed as the Chinese economy grows, topping state firms. [CLS] [SEP] Chinese coffee chain Luckin Coffee Inc., which was listed on the Nasdaq in 2019, disclosed in April last year that its chief operating officer fabricated the company’s sales, leading to concerns over China’s auditing system regarding firms listed overseas. [CLS] [SEP] In December, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was signed into law in the U.S., prohibiting foreign companies from listing their securities on any of the U.S. exchanges if an identified issuer’s auditor cannot be inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The primary impact of the law will be on Chinese issuers whose audit papers cannot be inspected by the PCAOB because of local laws that prevent inspections by foreign agencies. [CLS] [SEP] The Chinese government has maintained that it will not grant foreign authorities direct access to the accounting documents of Chinese companies. [CLS] [SEP] And then the Didi incident happened. [CLS] [SEP] The Chinese government, which claims data sovereignty — all data within China, including that held by companies, belongs to the state — now requires Chinese companies seeking to list overseas to go through strict regulatory screening by the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission if they have 1 million or more users with registered personal information. [CLS] [SEP] In response to such a move, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a statement on July 30 saying it would not allow Chinese companies to list on U.S. exchanges unless they disclose the risk of Beijing interfering in their businesses. [CLS] [SEP] Why is China taking such a harsh stance, when such a response by the U.S. was easily predictable? [CLS] [SEP] It seems to be making decisions based on three standpoints. [CLS] [SEP] Data sovereignty is a key issue that cannot be compromised amid U.S.-China friction. [CLS] [SEP] Even if Chinese firms are delisted in the U.S., they can be taken care of at exchanges in China and Hong Kong. [CLS] [SEP] It is the U.S. financial industry and investors, more than those in China, who will be affected by any delisting. [CLS] [SEP] All of these points are true. [CLS] [SEP] Complex and intertwined [CLS] [SEP] Many Chinese shares have been listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in recent years, attracting a large flow of funds from investors around the world, making it one of the major fundraising centers along with the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. [CLS] [SEP] Chinese shares listed in the U.S. are mostly held by foreign private equity funds and investors mainly on Wall Street, and those investing from mainland China are limited to founders and some other investors. [CLS] [SEP] A crash in the value of Didi's shares shortly after the firm went public came as the Chinese government announced in early July that it would tighten oversight of companies listed overseas. | BLOOMBERG [CLS] [SEP] A crash in the value of Didi’s shares shortly after the firm went public came as the Chinese government announced in early July that it would tighten oversight of companies listed overseas. | BLOOMBERG [CLS] [SEP] Didi’s biggest investor is SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund. [CLS] [SEP] If Chinese firms are delisted in the U.S., foreign investors might be the ones who will be most troubled. [CLS] [SEP] It will be difficult to avoid more Chinese firms from being delisted, considering a variety of complex and intertwined issues, including China’s strong stance and the U.S.’ uncompromising approach, a dispute over data sovereignty, the Chinese government’s increasing pressure on internet platformers and the U.S.’ sanctions around Chinese military firms. [CLS] [SEP] We should pay attention to how China and the U.S. will act regarding the following policies: [CLS] [SEP] Will China judge as illegal a structure known as Variable Interest Entities (VIE), created decades ago to allow Chinese companies to circumvent Chinese rules and get listed in the U.S.? [CLS] [SEP] Will the U.S. issue any order to investors in the U.S. not to invest in delisted Chinese firms? [CLS] [SEP] Since major Chinese companies listed in the U.S. use the VIE scheme for setting up an offshore company for overseas listing purposes, if the Chinese government decides to regard that as illegal, their shares will in theory become worthless, representing China’s declaration of a financial war against the U.S. [CLS] [SEP] And it would not be easy for the U.S. to issue an order that would choke American investors. [CLS] [SEP] Financial sanctions [CLS] [SEP] The other issue to focus on is the U.S. imposing financial sanctions on Chinese firms for national security concerns, like in the case of Huawei Technologies Co., or over human rights abuses against Uyghurs in China’s Xinjiang region, as well as for doing business with Beijing officials involved in the crackdown on Hong Kong. [CLS] [SEP] Financial sanctions carry the risk of triggering a retaliatory cycle, such as China selling U.S. Treasury bonds, the U.S. freezing Chinese financial assets and excluding Chinese banks from the dollar-based payment system among financial institutions and companies. Such retaliatory measures could lead the global economy into tremendous chaos. [CLS] [SEP] Such full-scale financial sanctions, if imposed, could even prompt China to invade Taiwan, much like how the U.S. ban on oil exports to Japan contributed to those countries entering World War II. [CLS] [SEP] Because financial sanctions are intended to pressure companies in all aspects — including foreign exchange, money transfers and deposits — the U.S., with the dollar as the key currency, has an overwhelming advantage. [CLS] [SEP] Being well aware of the situation, China appears to be concentrating on the following policies: [CLS] [SEP] Try to buy time by maintaining the status quo as much as possible. [CLS] [SEP] If the U.S. imposes financial sanctions, take decisive retaliatory measures to raise the costs of U.S. sanctions and remove them. [CLS] [SEP] Build its own international financial system. [CLS] [SEP] Although building its own international financial system will take time, there are two developments that should be noted. [CLS] [SEP] One is the Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), an independent onshore yuan clearing and settlement system China launched in 2015 and backed by the People’s Bank of China. [CLS] [SEP] More than 900 financial institutions across the world, including major banks in Japan and Western nations, are already participating in the system. [CLS] [SEP] The value of payment transactions conducted through the system in a year rose steadily from 4.36 trillion yuan (¥70 trillion) in 2016 to 45 trillion yuan (¥720 trillion) in 2020, but the yuan-denominated system still lags far behind the dollar-denominated currency system. [CLS] [SEP] The suspension of Chinese fintech giant Ant Group from markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong last November caused concern among Wall Street investors. | REUTERS [CLS] [SEP] The suspension of Chinese fintech giant Ant Group from markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong last November caused concern among Wall Street investors. | REUTERS [CLS] [SEP] The other development to watch is the establishment of the digital yuan, which is also attracting attention in Japan. [CLS] [SEP] China plans to officially launch the digital currency in time for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. If realized, it will become the world’s largest-scale digital currency issued by a central bank. [CLS] [SEP] Concerns are rising outside China that the creation of the digital yuan could threaten U.S. dollar hegemony, as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at a congressional hearing in October 2019: “If America doesn’t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.” [CLS] [SEP] However, there is only a small possibility that this will happen in the near future, since the digital yuan is so far only a cash-like digital payment system used within China by individuals, and the system by itself will not lead to the globalization of the yuan. [CLS] [SEP] To globalize a currency, a nation needs to have a free foreign-exchange policy and a system that guarantees liquidity of financial assets, something totally different from the creation of the digital yuan. [CLS] [SEP] Therefore, if the digital yuan is to expand outside China, it will be limited to some countries in Central and Southeast Asia that are under the influence of the Chinese economy and where the use of the yuan is available. [CLS] [SEP] Nondollar deals [CLS] [SEP] The biggest challenge for Western nations will be the possibility of blockchain technology and the system of the digital yuan becoming a de facto standard. [CLS] [SEP] If that happens, they will have to cope with data protection risks and the increase of nondollar deals. [CLS] [SEP] In May, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China set up a wealth management firm jointly with Goldman Sachs. | REUTERS [CLS] [SEP] In May, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China set up a wealth management firm jointly with Goldman Sachs. | REUTERS [CLS] [SEP] This is why central banks of industrialized countries, which had been slow to act on this issue, are starting research and development of digital currencies. [CLS] [SEP] While China is actively advancing a strategy to break dollar hegemony, it remains an uphill battle for the nation. We can say that there is no rationale for China to start a financial war now.
Microsoft (MSFT) Set to Release Windows 11 [CLS] [SEP] Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is set to release the latest version of its best-selling operating system Windows 11 on Oct. 5, the company announced in a blog post.1 Dubbed "the first version of a new era of Windows," the operating system is a long-awaited successor to Windows 10, which was released back in 2015.2 [CLS] [SEP] KEY TAKEAWAYS [CLS] [SEP] Microsoft is set to release Windows 11, the latest version of its best-selling operating system, on Oct. 5. [CLS] [SEP] Windows 11 features several upgrades for productivity in a hybrid work environment, a new Microsoft store, and is the "best Windows ever for gaming." [CLS] [SEP] Analysts estimate that Windows 11 will contribute 19% of Microsoft's overall profit margins for this year, [CLS] [SEP] Windows 11 features several updates aimed at many customer segments. For example, it has an updated Start menu and a sleek design of rounded corners and sharper colors that some say is similar to Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) Mac OS.3 [CLS] [SEP] The operating system is also equipped with a new Microsoft store for apps and games that allows access to Android apps. The company is also going head-to-head with competitor Apple by making the store more developer-friendly. Microsoft plans to take a 15% cut, as opposed to Apple's standard 30% share, from developers for apps on its platform. With integrated gaming subscription services and graphics features that make games more lifelike, Windows 11 is also being touted as the the "best Windows ever for gaming." [CLS] [SEP] In a nod to the changed post-pandemic workspace, Windows 11 provides easy access to Microsoft Teams, the company's virtual meeting software, and incorporates features like expanded gesture, voice, and pen interactivity to make it easier to participate in office conferences and school instruction. [CLS] [SEP] On Oct. 5, Windows 10 PCs will be upgraded to Windows 11. Devices with the new operating system will also become available for purchase on that date. The new operating system will work on machines equipped with processors dating back all the way to 2016 Intel chips. [CLS] [SEP] Windows and Microsoft's Balance Sheet [CLS] [SEP] Less than a decade ago, commercial licensing for Windows was Microsoft's cash cow.4 While its dominance on Microsoft's balance sheet has receded in recent times, the unit still accounted for $6.6 billion in revenue, approximately 14% of the total number, in the most recent quarter. [CLS] [SEP] Meanwhile, its cloud products and services division has become integral to its future as a technology company. Recently, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives chose Microsoft as his pick for the company most likely to win the "cloud arms race." Ives wrote, "Microsoft remains our favorite large cap cloud play, and we believe the stock will move higher into year-end as the Street further appreciates the cloud transformation story,"5 [CLS] [SEP] Microsoft has already released a cloud version of the Windows operating system—Windows 365—for users. The company claimed to have invented a new product category, one that it calls "Cloud PC," that enables users to work from anywhere using custom-built cloud configuration and an operating system available in a browser. [CLS] [SEP] But the standard version of Windows still provides several benefits to Microsoft. For starters, it dominates the PC market. Gartner estimated that 83% of PCs were running on the operating system last year.6 [CLS] [SEP] Windows also carries hefty margins. In June, when Microsoft provided a demo of Windows 11, UBS analyst Karl Keirstead estimated that the operating system carries a 90% to 95% margin for the company. He stated that Windows will account for 14% of the total revenue for Microsoft this year. Thanks to its high profit margins, however, the operating system will contribute approximately 19% to the company's profits. According to Keirstead, Windows "is central to Microsoft's franchise with enterprises and consumers."7
Is Palantir Stock a Buy? [CLS] [SEP] nnovation isn't just about what a company sells but also about how management runs the business. Big data software company Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is getting creative, planting seeds now that could yield revenue growth down the road. [CLS] [SEP] The stock receives much attention from Wall Street, but don't let that alone push you to consider Palantir for your portfolio. Here are three reasons Palantir is a great investment idea for long-term investors. [CLS] [SEP] 1. Big data is a big market opportunity [CLS] [SEP] British mathematician Clive Humby said in 2006: [CLS] [SEP] Data is the new oil. It's valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used. It has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc. to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so must data be broken down, analyzed for it to have value. [CLS] [SEP] Man analyzing large amounts of data. [CLS] [SEP] IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. [CLS] [SEP] Humby said this before Apple launched the iPhone, when the internet was in its infancy -- the very first year that cloud provider Amazon Web Services launched and six years before Tesla sold its first Model S. [CLS] [SEP] In fact, it's estimated that 90% of the world's data was created in the past two years because the growth of data is exponential. There are constantly more data points being recorded, more things producing data points, and more uses for that data. [CLS] [SEP] The problem is that data has been created for far longer than organizations have thought of utilizing it or had the tools to do so. Roughly 80%-90% of the world's data is unstructured, or as Humby puts it: "unrefined." [CLS] [SEP] Palantir's Gotham platform helps government organizations better understand their data to generate insights and aid decision making, while its Foundry functions similarly for commercial customers. It describes itself as an "operating system" for its customers, using artificial intelligence to make data actionable, driving smarter decision-making. [CLS] [SEP] It's estimated that the global market opportunity for big data is worth more than $200 billion today and could cross $450 billion over the next five years. Data never expires; more is only created over time, which means the services that can manage it could only see increased demand moving forward. [CLS] [SEP] 2. Nurturing long-term growth opportunities [CLS] [SEP] Palantir has grown by increasing its footing with the U.S. government; its government revenue grew 66% year over year in 2021 Q2. In the quarter, the company's overall revenue grew 49% to $376 million, meaning that government revenue is growing faster than commercial revenue (which grew 28% year over year in Q2). [CLS] [SEP] Whereas the government contracts are typically for in-demand projects, Palantir takes a long-term approach to its commercial growth strategy. It has made equity investments in several small companies, many of which went public (or have been announced as deals) via special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. [CLS] [SEP] As part of the terms of its investments, Palantir is receiving future revenue commitments from these companies. As of the quarter ending June 30th, 2021, Palantir disclosed $250 million in investments spread across 10 companies, with total revenue commitments of $428 million. Palantir now has an incentive to work with these companies and help them grow, which increases the value of its equity stakes in addition to the revenue commitments. [CLS] [SEP] Palantir continues to invest, with satellite data company BlackSky Technology being the most recent, and we will see an updated breakdown of Palantir's investments in its next quarterly filing. [CLS] [SEP] 3. The financials are rapidly improving [CLS] [SEP] Palantir brings customers onboard its platform often at a loss, to prove itself a vital component of its customers' operations. As Gotham/Foundry expands and increases its value to the customer, Palantir's revenue and the relationship become increasingly profitable. [CLS] [SEP] We see evidence of this in Palantir's financials. The revenue from its top 20 customers grew 36% year over year in Q2 to $39 million each. These larger customers are now helping the company's overall profitability. [CLS] [SEP] After burning $232 million in cash (negative free cash flow) in the first six months of 2020, Palantir has produced a positive free cash flow of $201 million over the first half of 2021, a dramatic turnaround. Investors should look for this to continue trending up and Palantir's free cash flow streams to begin building up its balance sheet for future opportunities. [CLS] [SEP] A pricey but compelling stock [CLS] [SEP] Trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 28 using the company's expected full-year 2021 revenue of $1.5 billion, it's a fair argument that Palantir stock is expensive. Management is pursuing 30% or higher revenue growth over the next four years, and it could surpass that if these small customers grow fast enough over the years to come. [CLS] [SEP] Palantir seems like a compelling investment idea despite its expensive valuation because of the sheer size of the "big data" market opportunity, as well as the company's accelerating free cash flow growth. CEO Alex Karp needs to continue to execute Palantir's growth strategy, but long-term investors could still be rewarded moving forward.
Palantir backs satellite intelligence company [CLS] [SEP] Palantir has extended its partnership with an emerging geospatial intelligence firm by making an equity investment. [CLS] [SEP] Terms of Palantir's investment in BlackSky Holdings were not disclosed, but it follows a pilot program that saw BlackSky deliver insights and intelligence to Palantir customers within minutes of collection and without human interaction. [CLS] [SEP] BlackSky said Wednesday that program involved several geospatial intelligence customers. [CLS] [SEP] “This collaboration further enables BlackSky to put the power of real-time intelligence in the hands of the user by allowing Palantir customers to directly task our satellites, reduce decision-making timelines and increase the delivery of on-demand insights,” BlackSky CEO Brian O’Toole said in a release. [CLS] [SEP] Following the pilot, the two companies have signed a multi-year software subscription agreement. They will integrate BlackSKy’s Spectra AI offering with Palantir Foundry. [CLS] [SEP] “This partnership directly connects space sensors to action, accelerating operations across domains, from space to mud,” said Palantir Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar. [CLS] [SEP] BlackSky is in the process of combining with Osprey Technology Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company formed to acquire another business and take it to the public markets.] [CLS] [SEP] That deal is expected to close Sept. 8, after which BlackSky will list on the New York Stock Exchange.
Uber drivers to stage 24-hour strike [CLS] [SEP] Drivers at ride hailing giant Uber are staging a strike on Tuesday over issues including pay and claims that workers are being unfairly dismissed. [CLS] [SEP] Members of the App Drivers and Couriers Union (ADCU) will hold protests in London, Bristol, Birmingham, Nottingham, Sheffield, Manchester, Leeds and Glasgow, and are urging people not to use the service during the 24-hour walkout. [CLS] [SEP] The union has accused the company of failing to implement a court ruling to pay waiting time, which it says makes up around 40% of an Uber driver’s working time, and claims that large numbers of drivers are being unfairly sacked. [CLS] [SEP] Uber insisted it is working with unions to raise standards for drivers. [CLS] [SEP] The union is also in dispute over the introduction of fixed price fares which it claims has led to reduced driver incomes. [CLS] [SEP] Yaseen Aslam, ADCU president said: “It is shameful that Uber continues to defy the highest court in the land to cheat 70,000 workers out of pay for 40% of their true working time. [CLS] [SEP] “The drivers know they deserve and are legally entitled to much more than Uber is offering. [CLS] [SEP] “This strike is just the beginning and there will be much more unrest until Uber does the right thing and pays drivers all that they are owed, both pension contributions and working time.” [CLS] [SEP] General secretary James Farrar added: “Uber has continued to intensify its use of junk surveillance tech and algorithmic management control to maximise profits. [CLS] [SEP] “The results have been catastrophic, with hundreds of people unfairly dismissed and accused of unspecified ‘fraudulent activity’. [CLS] [SEP] To view this content, you'll need to update your privacy settings. [CLS] [SEP] Please click here to do so. [CLS] [SEP] “Instead of trying to gag unions from exposing the flaws in their tech, Uber should instead guarantee all drivers protection from unfair dismissal and the right to access a proper, human-led appeals process.” [CLS] [SEP] An Uber spokesperson said: “Following the historic trade union recognition deal with GMB, drivers have an even stronger voice within Uber. [CLS] [SEP] “We are working together with our trade union partner to raise standards for drivers through greater transparency and engagement. [CLS] [SEP] “GMB represents drivers in areas such as earnings, deactivations and the implementation of new worker benefits, such as holiday pay and pensions.” [CLS] [SEP] Uber formally recognised the GMB earlier this year, saying the union could represent up to 70,000 Uber drivers across the UK. [CLS] [SEP] Uber announced in March that 70,000 drivers will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage, with paid-for holiday time. Those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan.
American Airlines vs. United: Which Airline Stock Is a Better Investment? [CLS] [SEP] The airline sector was among the worst hit amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  Traveling ground to a halt and airline companies burnt billions of dollars in cash to stay afloat. [CLS] [SEP] Since the onset of the coronavirus, most airline stocks have modestly rebounded from their Spring 2020 lows but the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) is still trading down more than 23% from it’s pre-covid level.  This could be an opportune time to take advantage of these cheaper prices, as economies around the world continue to reopen. [CLS] [SEP] Which is why today I’m going to analyze two stocks in the airline industry, American Airlines (AAL - Get Rating) and United Airlines (UAL - Get Rating), to see which is currently a better buy. [CLS] [SEP] American Airlines disappointed investors in Q2 [CLS] [SEP] In June this year, American Airlines claimed that its load factors and bookings were experiencing a surge. The load factor is the percentage of seats occupied by paying customers. However, its Q2 sales were still forecast to decline by almost 40% compared to the same period in 2019. [CLS] [SEP] American Airlines later forecast that revenue decline in the June quarter of 2021 would be lower than expected at 37.5% compared to Q2 of 2019. Its capacity was also forecast to fall by 24.6% in the same period. [CLS] [SEP] American Airlines reported a sequential growth of 87% in sales as it ended Q2 with revenue of $7.5 billion. In Q2 of 2019, its sales were $12 billion. The company’s pre-tax profit was positive [CLS] [SEP] due to a $1.4 billion grant by the federal government. [CLS] [SEP] 7 SEVERELY UNDERVALUED STOCKS [CLS] [SEP] In Q3 it expects a revenue decline of 20% compared to 2019 as capacity might reduce between 15% and 20%. This suggests the nonfuel unit costs for American Airlines will rise between 8% and 12%. [CLS] [SEP] Comparatively, the management has projected non-operating costs to increase from $251 million to $385 million due to its debt load. This will expectedly impact the bottom-line as its adjusted pre-tax margin will trend between -7% and -3%. [CLS] [SEP] American Airlines ended Q2 with $17.95 billion in cash and $48.3 billion in debt. Analysts also expect the company to report an adjusted loss of $7.62 per share in 2021. [CLS] [SEP] United Airlines reported better than expected results in Q2 [CLS] [SEP] In April 2021, United Airlines expected sales of $5 billion in Q2 with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $1 billion and a pre-tax loss of $2 billion. Less than two months later, it increased sales forecasts to $5.47 billion and narrowed EBITDA losses to $595 million. A faster-than-expected recovery in international flights and business-related travel also allowed the company to report a positive EBITDA of $212 million in the last month of Q2. [CLS] [SEP] It finally reported revenue of $5.47 billion in Q2 with an adjusted loss of $1.6 billion in the quarter. After accounting for the federal benefit of $1.1 billion, United Airlines’ loss narrowed to $564 million. United Airlines’ cash balance stood at $21.07 billion while its debt balance is $41.76 billion. [CLS] [SEP] The verdict [CLS] [SEP] United Airlines and American Airlines are both experiencing a recovery in top-line and profit margins this year. But I believe United Airlines is currently the better investment due to its improved liquidity position and lower debt levels. Further, United Airlines also expected to report an adjusted profit in Q3 and Q4 of 2021, something American Airlines might struggle to achieve. [CLS] [SEP] Want More Great Investing Ideas?
