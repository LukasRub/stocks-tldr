Retail giant Kohl's has been on a roll in the markets after a blowout earnings report and CEO Michelle Gass tagged the company’s success on its lifestyle approach on "The Claman Countdown."

Kohl's partnerships with major brands like Sephora, Lego and others have increased foot traffic in stores which Gass explained drives relevancy and widens the department store's demographic.

"We’ve been on a mission to really evolve and… transform the customer experience," she said. "Take everything that’s been great about Kohl's for years – we have phenomenal private brands like Sonoma, Croft & Barrow and the like – but also to bring more relevancy with new brands and new partnerships."

According to Gass, Kohl's is investing largely in active brands, as well as other differentiating names to detach from its "semi-department store" stigma.

The Kohl's-Amazon fusion has been beneficial for both companies, Gass explained, with Amazon’s large customer outreach and Kohl's stores being in close proximity to a wide majority of Americans being a perfect balance.
