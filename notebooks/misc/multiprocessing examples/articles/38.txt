What’s Next For Macy’s Stock After An 8% Move Last Week?

Macy’s stock (NYSE: M), a department store chain, increased by 8% in the last five trading days (one week). In comparison, the broader S&P500 index grew marginally over the same period. The company announced its plans to hire 76,000 employees for the upcoming holiday season, with approximately 37% of these new hires in permanent positions. Last year, about 6,800 seasonal workers remained with the company after holiday hiring in 2020. That said, the market reacted upward to this news probably because Macy’s M +3.2% has fewer stores this year than in previous years, and yet they are hiring roughly the same amount of people for this holiday season. By the look of things, the company looks well-positioned to mitigate supply chain issues heading into the back half of the fiscal year.

Macy’s saw a stellar fiscal second-quarter after beating revenue and earnings expectations. The retailer’s sales increased 2% to $5.65 billion and adjusted earnings per share more than quadrupled to $1.29 compared to the fiscal 2019 quarter. To add to this, the company’s comparable sales increased 5.9% relative to the second quarter of 2019. It should be noted that Macy’s expenses remained well below the 2019 levels, due to store closures, cost-cutting measures, and temporary under-staffing related to the tight labor market. Looking ahead, the company continues to expect significant earnings growth in Q3 as well, with adjusted EPS of $0.17 to $0.26, up from $0.07 in Q3 2019. However, it also estimates Q3 sales to come in between $5.04 billion and $5.19 billion, compared to $5.17 billion two years ago. This forecast implies a sequential slowdown in growth, most likely due to the recent surge in Covid-19 cases associated with the Delta variant.
