Bezos’ Blue Origin loses NASA lawsuit over SpaceX $2.9 billion lunar lander contract [CLS] [SEP] KEY POINTS [CLS] [SEP] 1. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled against Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin in the company’s lawsuit against NASA over a $2.9 billion lunar lander contract awarded to SpaceX. [CLS] [SEP] 2. Federal judge Richard Hertling sided with the defense in his ruling, completing a months-long battle. [CLS] [SEP] 3. A Blue Origin spokesperson said in a statement that the company’s lawsuit “highlighted the important safety issues with the Human Landing System procurement process that must still be addressed.” [CLS] [SEP] 4. Musk, in a tweet replying to CNBC’s report on the ruling, posted a photo from the 2012 movie “Dredd.” [CLS] [SEP] The U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled against Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin on Thursday in the company’s lawsuit versus NASA over a lucrative astronaut lunar lander contract awarded to Elon Musk’s SpaceX earlier this year. [CLS] [SEP] Federal Judge Richard Hertling sided with the defense in his ruling, completing a monthslong battle after Blue Origin sued NASA in August. [CLS] [SEP] NASA said in a statement that work with SpaceX will resume “as soon as possible” now that the ruling has been issued. [CLS] [SEP] “There will be forthcoming opportunities for companies to partner with NASA in establishing a long-term human presence at the Moon under the agency’s Artemis program,” the agency added. [CLS] [SEP] A Blue Origin spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC that the company’s lawsuit “highlighted the important safety issues with the Human Landing System procurement process that must still be addressed.” [CLS] [SEP] “Returning astronauts safely to the Moon through NASA’s public-private partnership model requires an unprejudiced procurement process alongside sound policy that incorporates redundant systems and promotes competition. Blue Origin remains deeply committed to the success of the Artemis program,” the company said. [CLS] [SEP] Bezos personally added in a tweet that the ruling was “not the decision we wanted,” but noted that “we respect the court’s judgment” – implying that his company will not appeal the decision further. [CLS] [SEP] SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment on the ruling. [CLS] [SEP] Musk, in a tweet replying to CNBC’s report on the ruling, posted a photo from the 2012 movie “Dredd.” [CLS] [SEP] NASA in April awarded SpaceX with the sole contract for the agency’s Human Landing System program under a competitive process. Worth $2.9 billion, the SpaceX contract will see the company use its Starship rocket to deliver astronauts to the moon’s surface for NASA’s upcoming Artemis missions. [CLS] [SEP] SpaceX was competing with Blue Origin and Dynetics for what was expected to be two contracts, before NASA only awarded a single contract due to a lower-than-expected allocation for the program from Congress. [CLS] [SEP] Blue Origin quickly protested the decision with the U.S. Government Accountability Office, but the GAO in late July denied the company’s appeal – leading Bezos’ space company to escalate its legal action. Bezos is also the founder of e-commerce giant Amazon. [CLS] [SEP] A redacted version of Blue Origin’s lawsuit revealed the company’s complaint focused on proving that NASA wrongly awarded the contract to only SpaceX and “disregarded key flight safety requirements” in the process. [CLS] [SEP] Hertling’s ruling dismissed Blue Origin’s claims. The court’s opinion is currently sealed, as the case contains information proprietary to the companies, but the parties were ordered by Hertling to deliver proposed redactions by Nov. 18, to publicly release the opinion. [CLS] [SEP] NASA’s work with SpaceX on the HLS contract was halted during the lawsuit but is scheduled to resume Monday. [CLS] [SEP] The court’s decision, a blow to Blue Origin’s ambitions, comes at a mixed time of success and scrutiny for the company. [CLS] [SEP] Bezos has personally increased his involvement at Blue Origin, after he stepped down as the CEO of Amazon. While the company has flown two successful crewed flights of its suborbital New Shepard rocket to date, Blue Origin has suffered from soaring employee turnover and allegations of safety issues, as well as a “toxic” work culture, by former workers. [CLS] [SEP] But Blue Origin has continued to work toward achieving Bezos’ vision for the company, which is “millions of people are living and working in space to benefit Earth,” especially by moving “industries that stress Earth into space.” Last month Blue Origin announced a private space station called Orbital Reef in partnership with a consortium of space companies, with aims to deploy it in orbit later this decade.
Oil recovers from U.S. inflation-driven plunge [CLS] [SEP] Summary [CLS] [SEP] 1. OPEC lowers oil demand forecast for end of 2021 [CLS] [SEP] 2. Biden administration could order oil reserves release [CLS] [SEP] 3. Brent looks to be consolidating below $85 a barrel -analyst [CLS] [SEP] LONDON, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose above $83 a barrel in volatile trading on Thursday, recovering from sharp falls triggered by concerns over increasing U.S. inflation as OPEC cut its 2021 oil demand forecast due to high energy prices. [CLS] [SEP] Brent crude futures rose 63 cents, or 0.76%, to $83.27 a barrel by 1443 GMT after falling earlier to $81.66. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were up 63 cents, or 0.77%, at $81.97 after hitting a session low of $80.20. [CLS] [SEP] The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said in a monthly report it expects oil demand to average 99.49 million barrels per day (bpd) in the fourth quarter of 2021, down 330,000 bpd from last month's forecast. read more [CLS] [SEP] "A slowdown in the pace of recovery in the fourth quarter of 2021 is now assumed due to elevated energy prices," OPEC said in the report, also citing slower-than-expected demand in China and India for the downward revision. [CLS] [SEP] OPEC sees world consumption surpassing the 100 million bpd mark in the third quarter of 2022, three months later than forecast last month. [CLS] [SEP] On Wednesday, data showed U.S. inflation increased by 6.2%, the fastest rate in 30 years, driven largely by steeper energy prices, pushing the dollar higher and sending Brent and WTI crude down by 2.5% and 3.3% respectively. read more [CLS] [SEP] A rise in U.S. oil stocks after a government release of some strategic reserves put further pressure on prices. [CLS] [SEP] In response to the rising inflation, U.S. President Joe Biden said he asked the National Economic Council to work to reduce energy costs and the Federal Trade Commission to push back on market manipulation in the energy sector to reverse inflation. [CLS] [SEP] "Crude prices are trying to find their footing after yesterday's slide as runaway inflation in America is adding pressure on the Biden administration to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR)," said Edward Moya, senior analyst at OANDA. [CLS] [SEP] "Energy traders know that an SPR release will only deliver a very short-term drop in prices that won't provide much relief for the American consumer." [CLS] [SEP] The Brent crude price has gained more than 60% this year and hit a three-year high of $86.70 on Oct. 25, supported by recovering demand and supply restraint by OPEC and its allies, together known as OPEC+. [CLS] [SEP] But oil prices appear to be consolidating below $85 a barrel, Norbert Rucker, head of economics at Julius Baer, said in a note. [CLS] [SEP] "We could be looking at early signs of a fundamental transition towards an easing market, not least as oil demand should only grow gradually going forward with the pick-up in U.S. shale and petro-nation supply."
COP26 Climate Summit in Glasgow: What to Expect [CLS] [SEP] Experts have warned that time is running out to avoid climate catastrophe. Will the global climate conference spark action? [CLS] [SEP] Representatives from countries around the world will gather in Glasgow, Scotland, for the latest round of climate talks—the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties (COP26)—during the first two weeks of November. [CLS] [SEP] What’s at stake? [CLS] [SEP] Scientists and UN officials have warned that if governments don’t take drastic action to reduce emissions immediately, much of the world will suffer climate catastrophes, such as devastating sea-level rise, longer and more intense heat waves, and widespread species loss, among other consequences. [CLS] [SEP] The Paris accord aims to keep the global average temperature from rising by 1.5°C (2.7°F) above preindustrial levels and, failing that, prevent it from reaching 2°C (3.6°F) above. But the world has already warmed 1.1°C, and a UN assessment [PDF] released in August predicted that warming will exceed 1.5°C within the next two decades. [CLS] [SEP] COP26 is the first time since the Paris Agreement that countries are revisiting their voluntary commitments under the accord. More than one hundred countries have already submitted new targets, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). However, experts say that even these new NDCs are not enough to prevent devastating temperature rise. [CLS] [SEP] What are the aims of COP26? [CLS] [SEP] Debate will likely focus on the following issues: [CLS] [SEP] Climate finance. Experts say climate finance will likely emerge as one of the most challenging issues of COP26. Developing countries, which have contributed the least to emissions levels, are demanding that developed countries follow through on a pledge to mobilize $100 billion per year to help them reduce emissions and adapt to the worsening effects of climate change. Another issue expected to come up is how to assist nations already experiencing loss and damage due to climate change. [CLS] [SEP] Carbon markets. All components of the Paris Agreement’s so-called rulebook—the guidelines for how to implement the accord—have already been agreed upon, except for Article 6. That section deals with how to develop and implement so-called international carbon markets, which allow for the trading of emissions-reduction credits. [CLS] [SEP] Coal. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is hosting COP26, has called on developed countries to stop using coal—a major source of emissions—by 2030 and for other countries to phase it out by 2040. However, discussions on coal have already been contentious. Earlier this year, the Group of Seven (G7) failed to agree on a date to stop using coal. China and India, which in recent weeks have suffered energy crises partly due to coal shortages, have also resisted committing to eliminating coal. [CLS] [SEP] Methane. Leaders will formally pledge to cut methane emissions by at least 30 percent by 2030, a goal that was unveiled by the United States and the European Union in September. More than a dozen countries have already signed the pact. The world’s top methane emitter, China, has not yet joined. [CLS] [SEP] Who’s coming? [CLS] [SEP] Some twenty thousand diplomats, business executives, and activists are expected to converge on Glasgow. Dozens of world leaders are also planning to attend, including U.S. President Joe Biden. [CLS] [SEP] It will be the first COP since the United States reentered the Paris Agreement this year, and the Biden administration will likely take a significant role in the negotiations. However, at home, the administration has struggled to pass its sweeping climate bill in Congress. There are serious concerns that any passable climate legislation would not go far enough, which could damage U.S. credibility on the international stage. “The question that is on everyone’s minds is: Can the United States fulfill its commitments under the Paris accord?” says Robert N. Stavins, an environmental economist at Harvard University. [CLS] [SEP] Meanwhile, the leaders of some of the highest-emitting countries will be absent, including Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Russian President Vladimir Putin, although they are expected to send negotiators. Chinese President Xi Jinping has not yet said whether he will attend in person; China’s climate envoy and other officials are planning to be there. [CLS] [SEP] Will negotiators make progress in Glasgow? [CLS] [SEP] The commitments that governments make during COP26 are unlikely to be ambitious enough to prevent temperatures from rising 1.5°C or even 2°C, although a few countries could make surprise announcements. [CLS] [SEP] Nonetheless, COP26 will set the stage for negotiations that will continue both within the COP process and outside of it. Climate change will likely be a central topic at future multilateral summits, such as those of the G7 and Group of Twenty (G20), as well as within national governments. [CLS] [SEP] A successful COP would be one that instills “a sense that we’re still in it together as a world,” says Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center, “and a sense of a commonly owned agenda where we will continue to raise ambition over the coming years.”
The Reddit revolt: GameStop and the impact of social media on institutional investors [CLS] [SEP] Following the explosive events surrounding GameStop in January, Annabel Smith unpacks the role of social media in this cautionary tale and its impact on institutional investors. [CLS] [SEP] The Reddit revolution in the US has drawn attention to the potential power that a growing force of retail investors can wield in stock markets when equipped by social media. [CLS] [SEP] Amateur investors have increasingly engaged with retail platforms in the last year, partly due to the pandemic leaving them idol at home, but also due to the newfound onslaught of information through social media and access to the market through retail brokerages and platforms such as Robinhood. [CLS] [SEP] Set up in 2013 the mobile trading app, now valued at $21 billion and proclaimed to be democratising finance, offers investors access to the financial markets with zero commissions. [CLS] [SEP] “For the largest online brokers, the number of daily trades has tripled since 2019,” John Marshall, head of derivatives research at Goldman Sachs, commented on a retail investment podcast from the US bank. “But this has mainly been driven by a small portion of their customer base. These day traders are less than 10% of their customers, but they represent more than half of their trades.” [CLS] [SEP] Meme-stocks [CLS] [SEP] The events that took place involved stocks such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment in what is considered one of the first social media driven and coordinated buying regimes by retail investors. It resulted in market conditions likened to the dot com bubble around the turn of the century, leading to concerns that institutional investors must now adapt their risk models to mitigate the possibility of this happening again. [CLS] [SEP] To put the gravity of the situation into perspective, on 27 January at the height of the GameStop saga, 24 billion shares were traded on US exchanges, surpassing the previously set record by 4 billion shares traded in the 2008 global financial crisis. [CLS] [SEP] “Until now, retail trading activity has never been able to move the market one way or another. However, following the successful coordination by a large group of traders, the power dynamic has shifted; exposing the vulnerability of the market as well as the weaknesses in firms’ trading systems,” says Guy Warren, chief executive officer of FinTech ITRS Group. [CLS] [SEP] “20 February marks one year since the beginning of the COVID-19 stock market crash. Twelve months on and the trading landscape has changed forever – but not as a consequence of the global pandemic. Instead, the retail trading revolt of Reddit users has been the catalyst to change the game entirely.” [CLS] [SEP] Well-informed individuals keen to manipulate the market, posted information on social media forums such as the Reddit chatroom r/wallstreetbets, which boasts 4.8 million members, encouraging the masses to buy shares with the hope that it would drive the price of certain stocks up. Motives behind this onslaught ranged from making personal profit to a desire to squeeze the short positions of hedge funds. [CLS] [SEP] Prompted by the information posted on social media retail investors began buying these so called “meme-stocks” including GameStop, AMC Entertainment, Blackberry, and Nokia. The activity sent their prices soaring, with the GameStop share prices climbing over 1000% in just two weeks. [CLS] [SEP] Retail investors usually focus on large-cap names as opposed to the small-cap consumer stocks undergoing structural challenges. Information on social media, however, drew attention to these struggling companies. [CLS] [SEP] “When investors see testimonials of others that have had outsized returns their attracted to more speculative trading strategies,” added Marshall in the Goldman Sachs podcast. [CLS] [SEP] On 26 January, billionaire chief executive of electric car company Tesla, Elon Musk, affectionately dubbed Papa Musk on Reddit, tweeted “Gamestonk!!” with a link to the r/wallstreetbets chatroom. Musk’s twitter profile with 48 million followers gathered even more momentum for the exploding GameStop share price increase. [CLS] [SEP] “We’ve all seen what happens to markets when Elon Musk tweets something.  Somebody might want to take his phone charger away for a while,” says Matt McLoughlin, head of trading at Liontrust Asset Management. [CLS] [SEP] “However, this is the first time that we’ve witnessed social media being used by groups of people to move markets. There are other challenges that social media will bring to financial markets and this is probably the first taster of what’s to come.” [CLS] [SEP] Steal from the rich to give to the poor [CLS] [SEP] GameStop was heavily shorted by hedge funds. As a brick and mortar shop during a global pandemic selling physical games in an increasingly digitised market, the company was expected to underperform. [CLS] [SEP] Through social media, retail investors weaponised their involvement in stock markets to negatively affect hedge funds who had taken short positions in companies like GameStop. [CLS] [SEP] “A co-ordinated and well-informed market manipulation used retail platforms like Robinhood to squeeze shorts on the likes of GameStop and AMC,” says Steve Keslo, head of markets at ITI Capital. [CLS] [SEP] A short squeeze takes place when a price is deliberately driven higher to increase the losses of hedge funds that had bet the price would fall. It is exacerbated by the fact that hedge funds with short bets are also forced to buy back shares to minimise their losses, further driving the price up. [CLS] [SEP] According to data and analytics firm S3 Partners, by 27 January short sellers had accumulated losses of more than $5 billion in 2021, including a loss of $1.6 billion on the 22 January and $917 million on 25 January. [CLS] [SEP] Social media forums have become breeding grounds for ‘activism investment’ and an anti-Wall Street establishment movement, driven by retail investors who have banded together in a bid to take down financial institutions by squeezing their short positions. [CLS] [SEP] “In wider society, financial markets don’t have the best reputation and outsiders view hedge funds in an even worse light, which is probably why they have been targeted in the GameStop saga,” explains McLoughlin. [CLS] [SEP] “Some GIFs on social media platforms said that it would be funny to take a global investment bank down. I don’t think it would be funny for the US economy or good for the individuals making those GIFs if that actually happened.  There is sometimes a disconnect between what is put on social media and reality.” [CLS] [SEP] Rethink risk [CLS] [SEP] With many Reddit revolutionaries praising the chaos that has ensued for certain financial institutions there is the potential for another coordinated social media-fuelled squeeze to take place, and for this reason, institutional investors will need to place a greater emphasis on risk management practices. [CLS] [SEP] Social media has continued to play a role in stock markets since the GameStop saga. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stepped in and banned trading in six names on 26 February following speculation that they “may also have been targets of apparent social media attempts to artificially inflate their stock price”. [CLS] [SEP] Reddit favourites such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment also continued to rally on 1 March, rising 10.1% and 13.7% respectively, as more day traders congregated on social media to try and repeat the spikes seen in January. [CLS] [SEP] The risk models of certain hedge funds and institutional investors proved themselves redundant in a situation like the one that unfolded in January. As an event like it has never happened before, risk models have never had to comprehend the situation that took place and were subsequently not equipped to manage them. [CLS] [SEP] “If you’re a hedge fund engaged in the practice of shorting and that’s part of your business model, you’re running a long book and a short book and you’re relatively balanced, you’ve had a certain view of how much risk any single-name short position could be,” Raj Mahajan, global head of systematic client franchise at Goldman Sachs, said alongside Marshall in the Goldman Sachs podcast. [CLS] [SEP] “But what we learned last week is that the risk models didn’t contemplate a 10x move in the short against you or a 20x move in the short against you.” [CLS] [SEP] As their positions became increasingly squeezed, hedge funds were also forced to reduce their leverage by trading in more solid and secure stocks. This in turn has meant that long-only buy-side firms have felt the effects of the volatility taking place in the short market. [CLS] [SEP] “This situation was important for long investors to understand because all of a sudden hedge funds started selling long positions in other solid names where asset managers were investing, and all of a sudden you had some limited selling pressure in these names,” says Christoph Hock, head of multi-asset trading at Union Investment. [CLS] [SEP] Not dissimilar from the way Yahoo message boards were used by traders in the past to inform themselves about trading strategies and trends, institutional traders will now have to pay greater attention to information posted on social media platforms such as Reddit and Twitter. [CLS] [SEP] Retail participation in a particular stock will have to be assessed further by those intending to invest in it and hedge funds in particular will have to pay close attention to posts on Reddit in order to stay ahead of the curve. [CLS] [SEP] “These days to fully get the picture right to understand what’s going on in the market you definitely have to take into account what retail investors are doing,” adds Hock. [CLS] [SEP] Institutional investors may also be forced to further diversify their portfolios with alternative assets and strategies as a means to mitigate the risk associated with volatility in the equities market. [CLS] [SEP] “Asset managers will be increasingly aware of the asymmetric risk associated with shorting single-stock equities, particularly within market-neutral and traditional long-short vehicles and mandates. Instead, these traditional stock pickers will need to invest in the expertise of risk management via derivatives and more diverse hedging strategies,” explains Keslo. [CLS] [SEP] Eight-year highs in silver prices caused by retail investors following GameStop also forced Aberdeen Standard Investors to introduce a ‘Reddit Clause’ to its physically backed silver exchange traded-fund (ETF), referring to the potential manipulation of silver pricing through social media campaigns. [CLS] [SEP] Financial regulators now face a conundrum on how to regulate this squirming mass of individual social media accounts and how to determine what constitutes market manipulation. As the situation reached a crescendo on 28 January Robinhood was forced to place a ban on users purchasing securities such as GameStop that had gathered momentum on social media. [CLS] [SEP] Since then, outraged retail investors have filed multiple lawsuits against Robinhood, infuriated that institutions were not subject to similar bans and restrictions on trading. The question of whether access to the stock markets is sufficiently democratised is now firmly on the table and will continue to be debated for months to come. [CLS] [SEP] While the US equities markets has ultimately righted itself, the GameStop saga has identified a weakness that will need to be addressed. The face of the market has changed and with a growing number of people now able to access and share information through social media, the door remains open for further turbulence that could negatively impact institutional investors. [CLS] [SEP] “Asset managers and hedge funds will start to pay a lot more attention to the risks around social media and its potential impact,” McLoughlin concludes.
Student loans: Expert explains what the government can do as pandemic pause ends [CLS] [SEP] Student loan repayments are expected to restart at the end of January next year. [CLS] [SEP] But with one in five borrowers defaulting on their debt pre-pandemic, the government should tread carefully with at-risk borrowers, according to one expert. [CLS] [SEP] "For people who struggle to repay afterwards for various reasons... we need to continue to have sort of what I think of as off-ramps — ways for those people to move out of repayments so that they aren't permanently stuck in debt that they'll never be able to repay," Kevin Miller, associate director of higher education at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). [CLS] [SEP] Outstanding student loan debt currently stands at $1.58 trillion as of the third quarter, which is a $14 billion rise from the previous ,according to the New York Fed. [CLS] [SEP] About 5.3% of student loans were in serious delinquency or default, but since the government is reporting all federal students as on-time until January 31, 2022, the number is lower than pre-pandemic levels. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, the growth of student loans over the past decade has been historic: Federal student loans have grown from $642 billion in 2007 to $1.566 trillion in 2020 — a 144% increase, according to new report on the topic from the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC). [CLS] [SEP] The number of borrowers, however, has only increased by 52% over the same period. That's because students are borrowing more: Between 2007 and 2020, the average amount of federal student loan debt per borrower has increased from $22,680 to $36,510 in real terms, the BPC report stated. [CLS] [SEP] "Ultimately, that's going to be the responsibility of the federal government, because the federal government holds these debts," Miller said, adding that defaults lead to "billions of dollars that are not flowing back into the federal government where they're supposed to be." [CLS] [SEP] Miller estimated that the federal government could be accruing "maybe $50 billion a year" in costs due to uncollectible debt. [CLS] [SEP] 'People end up with permanent debt' [CLS] [SEP] Milled noted that the Education Department (ED), which owns the vast majority of student loans, could do "a more active job" of getting people into income-driven repayment (IDR) plans and avoid mass defaults. [CLS] [SEP] "Those are plans where if you have a really low income, your repayment rate per month can be as low as zero dollars," he explained. "So at that point, you won't default on the loan." [CLS] [SEP] ED has many types of IDR plans made available for federal borrowers as explained on its website, and the government may be considering a new plan in the coming months. [CLS] [SEP] But given how much effort is required to get rid of student loans, such as through bankruptcy or forgiveness, "people end up with permanent debt," Miller said. "What we want is a system that, first, discourages that from happening in the first place." [CLS] [SEP] Ultimately, the taxpayer is on the hook when a borrower can't repay their student loan debt. [CLS] [SEP] "Unpayable student debt is essentially going to be on the federal government's balance sheet... the federal government, the taxpayer, ends up bearing that cost," Miller said. "And so one of the things we need to think about really broadly as a society is how we finance college. Are we letting people access college in a way that is affordable?... the reality right now is that for most people, the answer is, no." [CLS] [SEP] So, he added, as the Biden administration considers reforms to the student loan machinery, "we need to think about building a system that's fair to borrowers, but also is going to rein in some of these costs over the long term."
COVID-19: What you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic on 10 November [CLS] [SEP] 1. How COVID-19 is affecting the globe [CLS] [SEP] Confirmed cases of COVID-19 have passed 250.9 million globally, according to Johns Hopkins University. The number of confirmed deaths has now passed 5.06 million. More than 7.34 billion vaccination doses have been administered globally, according to Our World in Data. [CLS] [SEP] The United States government is set to buy another $1 billion worth of the COVID-19 pill made by Merck and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, the companies announced yesterday. [CLS] [SEP] AstraZeneca is creating a separate division for vaccines and antibody therapies, the drugmaker said on Tuesday, to focus on its COVID-19 shot and the development of coronavirus treatments. [CLS] [SEP] Moderna has applied for European authorization of its COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 6-11 years, weeks after it delayed a similar filing in the United States. [CLS] [SEP] Guinea will begin vaccinating children aged 12-17 against COVID-19 with a consignment of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines on Wednesday, the health ministry said. Most African countries have been reliant on the COVAX vaccine sharing initiative for doses, and have inoculated only a small fraction of their populations. [CLS] [SEP] Canada has authorized a booster dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for people aged 18 and above. [CLS] [SEP] Vietnam will by the end of this month have sufficient vaccines to cover its population against COVID-19, a deputy prime minister said on Wednesday. [CLS] [SEP] Russian authorities have said that last week's nationwide workplace shutdowns have helped turn the tide of surging COVID-19 cases, but the country reported its largest one-day death toll of the pandemic so far on Tuesday. [CLS] [SEP] A group of hospitals in the southern Dutch province of Limburg on Tuesday called for the government to take new measures to stem rising COVID-19 cases, saying they have no space or staff to handle more coronavirus patients. [CLS] [SEP] 2. WHO warns of syringe shortage [CLS] [SEP] The World Health Organization is warning of a syringe shortage next year, which could impact not just COVID-19 vaccinations, but also routine immunisations and undermine needle safety. [CLS] [SEP] The WHO said the shortage could run to between one and two billion. National health authorities should plan their needs well in advance to avoid the "hoarding, panic buying and type of situation" seen early in the pandemic with the lack of personal protective equipment, WHO expert Lisa Hedman said. [CLS] [SEP] "We could have a global shortage of immunisation syringes that could in turn lead to serious problems such as slowing down immunisation efforts as well as safety concerns," she told a U.N. briefing. [CLS] [SEP] 3. Health workers in England to be required to get COVID-19 vaccine [CLS] [SEP] Health workers in England will be required to get a COVID-19 vaccine by 1 April, health minister Sajid Javid announced yesterday. He made it a mandatory condition of employment for those on the frontline of the National Health Service. [CLS] [SEP] Javid said he had to balance the benefit to patients and colleagues with concern that workers might decide to leave their jobs rather than get the shots. He said workplace pressures were one reason the measure would not come in until the spring. [CLS] [SEP] "All those working in the NHS and social care will have to be vaccinated. We must avoid preventable harm and protect patients in the NHS, protect colleagues in the NHS and of course protect the NHS itself," Javid told parliament. "We intend the enforcement of this condition to start on the 1st of April."
When the Taliban Are in Your Bedroom [CLS] [SEP] As armed Taliban inspected the New York Times bureau in Kabul, they were escorted by a journalist who used to be a U.S. Marine. The photo of him in uniform was plain for all to see, and ponder. [CLS] [SEP] KABUL, Afghanistan — When the Taliban are in your bedroom and there’s a photograph of you on the wall holding an American flag, a rifle and dressed like a recruiting commercial for the Marines, you have to keep it together. [CLS] [SEP] Then there’s the kitschy mug on your desk that you picked up from a shop just as Bagram Air Base closed in July. It reads, “Been there…done that/Operation Enduring Freedom.” [CLS] [SEP] And the empty beer can in your trash that you drank the night before Kabul fell in August when you had a feeling this might be the last beer you drink in Afghanistan for awhile because the insurgents-turned-rulers don’t take kindly to booze. [CLS] [SEP] And that photo of you in uniform? Taken just before the largest operation against the Taliban of the American war in Afghanistan, when you were a Marine in Helmand Province more than a decade ago. That was when the insurgents were shadows in the opposite tree line, but now, in October, they’re feet away, standing next to your bed, separated by a decade and a lost war. [CLS] [SEP] But the Taliban aren’t here to take anything or kill you, even though they had plenty of chances to do just that when you deployed in 2008, and in 2009. Or when you were a journalist in the country years afterward. [CLS] [SEP] But they still managed to kill some guys in your unit and blew others in half, something not lost on you as they pick up and put back a memorial bracelet engraved with the names of your friends (Josh, Matt and Brandon) and a line from a John McCrae poem: “We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow.” [CLS] [SEP] These Talibs insist they’re here to make sure nothing has been stolen from what was once the New York Times Kabul bureau, and that everything is right where we left it when all of the newspaper’s staff members fled the country, like thousands of other Afghans and foreigners did, in August as the Afghan government collapsed. [CLS] [SEP] And everything is right where I left it. There’s the new Xbox I bought at Dubai International Airport when I flew back into Afghanistan in late July, just about two weeks before Kabul fell, thinking that Kabul wouldn’t fall and that I’d have plenty of time to play Microsoft Flight Simulator. My dirty laundry is in the hamper. My bed is made. There is a thin layer of dust on everything. [CLS] [SEP] This is the reality now: the end of the war and the new beginning of the Islamic Emirate. [CLS] [SEP] The most distinct and reoccurring reminders of the long U.S. presence are the black American-supplied rifles now cradled by Taliban at checkpoints and on amusement rides and slung on the back of their motorbikes. The familiar and intrusive thunder of the helicopters flying into the U.S. Embassy is no more, because the U.S. Embassy is no more, and the surrounding Green Zone belongs to the Taliban. [CLS] [SEP] The Green Zone, or international zone, was blocks of concrete blast walls built around what was once an affluent neighborhood with tree-lined streets, until it was turned into a fortress that connected the American Embassy and NATO’s Resolute Support headquarters and a handful of other diplomatic missions. [CLS] [SEP] Now all that infrastructure is just a skeleton of a 20-year war, lost by the diplomats and soldiers who once lived inside it: a museum to failure. [CLS] [SEP] It’s where The New York Times and other news agencies kept their bureaus, and where I had returned last month to continue coverage of Afghanistan and inspect what had happened to our compound. [CLS] [SEP] It’s where the State Department contractors had a little base with a supposed Starbucks inside. It’s where embassy staff members dared not venture away from because the war was on. It’s where armored cars were abandoned as Westerners scurried onto helicopters, so they could be ferried out of the country as the Taliban entered the city. [CLS] [SEP] The Taliban now do what they please in the Green Zone. They’re investigating the abandoned structures, looking for spies and weapons or anything that could harm them because the people within the Green Zone once did just that, running the war from behind its walls. A blimp with cameras once floated above it, watching everything in the city in color and infrared. At Resolute Support headquarters, American officers authorized airstrikes that killed Taliban and civilians alike. [CLS] [SEP] Why wouldn’t the Taliban search every corner? Look under every desk? To them, it’s almost like the Green Zone is the Dragon King Under the Mountain, something that could turn the war back on if they somehow woke it up. [CLS] [SEP] “Are there military weapons here?” one Talib asks us, standing on the second floor of the Times bureau in a room where the security manager once painted miniature soldiers. He carried a suitcase full of them out of the country as it collapsed. [CLS] [SEP] No, there are no military weapons. [CLS] [SEP] One Talib points to the body armor on top of a closet. “This is military, no?” he asks in near-perfect English. “Why would you need this?” [CLS] [SEP] We needed the body armor because we were covering the war that just ended, where people killed one another with roadside bombs and artillery and airstrikes and Kalashnikovs. His question is almost obscene, as if the violence his band of insurgents and the Western-backed Afghan government and NATO and the United States perpetrated had existed in some parallel universe. [CLS] [SEP] We respond courteously because our new landlords are carrying a lot of weapons with them. [CLS] [SEP] I throw away a club soda that has been sitting on the kitchen table since August. The refrigerator is rancid. The garden is overgrown. [CLS] [SEP] The Taliban walk through the bureau inspecting a home and office frozen at the moment of collapse. On the bed in the room opposite mine is an open suitcase, half-packed, clothes scattered about. In the small newsroom downstairs, the white board that marked the fall of provincial capitals is still there, though in the end, the country fell apart too fast to track. [CLS] [SEP] On the wall is a map of the city of Kunduz and where the Taliban front lines once were, with the insurgents held in check for a few brief weeks by the demoralized and depleted Afghan security forces before they evaporated and the city fell. [CLS] [SEP] Now, in Kabul, the Taliban are driving around in the Afghan military’s trucks and Humvees and armored personnel carriers, and wearing their uniforms. [CLS] [SEP] “Free cars,” one Talib had messaged me days earlier from the front seat of some armored S.U.V. that had belonged to a contracting company or came from an abandoned military motor pool. He then sent a picture of his rifle, also free, with its markings circled: “Property of U.S. Gov. M4 Carbine. Cal 5.56 MM W0207610.” [CLS] [SEP] This is what losing a war looks like. And the Taliban are still in my bedroom. [CLS] [SEP] One looks about the same age I was in that photograph on my wall where I’m standing beside a gigantic and newly unpackaged American flag, holding that rifle and grinning, because I thought then we were going to win the war or turn the tide or kill the guys who are now sifting through my wardrobe, pointing to a pair of sneakers in my closet. The very shoes were the subject of an article we wrote: “In Afghanistan, Follow the White High-Tops and You’ll Find the Taliban.” [CLS] [SEP] He smiles, points and tries them on.
Human space traveler No. 600 is launched into orbit [CLS] [SEP] CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A SpaceX rocket carried four astronauts toward orbit Wednesday night, including the 600th person to reach space in 60 years. [CLS] [SEP] The repeatedly delayed flight occurred just two days after SpaceX brought four other astronauts home from the International Space Station. They should have been up there to welcome the newcomers, but NASA and SpaceX decided to switch the order based on Monday's ideal recovery weather in the Gulf of Mexico. [CLS] [SEP] Germany's Matthias Maurer claimed the No. 600 position, according to NASA, based on his mission assignment. He and his three NASA crewmates should arrive at the space station in under 24 hours, well over a week late. [CLS] [SEP] One of the astronauts — NASA isn't saying which one — was sidelined last week by an undisclosed medical issue. The crew member is fully recovered, according to NASA. Officials won't say whether it was an illness or injury, but noted it wasn't COVID-19. [CLS] [SEP] Bad weather also contributed to their flight delays. [CLS] [SEP] Wednesday's night it was drizzling when the four astronauts said goodbye to their families, with umbrellas held over them. Forecasters promised the weather would improve and it did. [CLS] [SEP] The list of 600 travelers ranges from those who have barely scratched space — like actor William Shatner last month — to U.S. and Russian astronauts who have spent a year or more in orbit. This year's surge in space tourists helped push the tally over the 600 mark. [CLS] [SEP] That averages out to 10 people per year since Yuri Gagarin's pioneering flight in 1961, Maurer noted. [CLS] [SEP] "But I think in a very few years, we will see an exponential rise of that one because now we're entering the era of commercial spaceflight," he said after arriving at NASA's Kennedy Space Center two weeks ago. [CLS] [SEP] The crew launch marked SpaceX's fourth for NASA in 1 1/2 years and the company's fifth passenger flight overall — a charter flight for four that skipped the space station. The Dragon capsule's toilet leaked during their three days in orbit in September, necessitating a quick redesign of the flushing system in the newest capsule, named Endurance by its crew. [CLS] [SEP] A balky parachute during Monday's descent had SpaceX engineers poring over the data, before giving the go-ahead for Wednesday's launch. One of the four chutes opened more than a minute late, a problem seen in testing and well within safety limits, SpaceX officials said Tuesday. [CLS] [SEP] Mauer is one of three newbies on the crew. The 51-year-old was a finalist when he first applied to be an astronaut with the European Space Agency. Encouraged, he left his research job at a medical company and joined the space agency as an engineer, and made the astronaut cut in 2015. [CLS] [SEP] Also on board: [CLS] [SEP] — Air Force Col. Raja Chari, 44, the first space rookie in decades to lead a mission to orbit for NASA. A test pilot from Cedar Falls, Iowa, Chari accumulated more than 2,500 hours in fighter jets, including combat missions in Iraq. [CLS] [SEP] — Dr. Thomas Marshburn, 61, will be the oldest person to live aboard the space station and perform a spacewalk. Born in Statesville, North Carolina, he pursued a career in emergency medicine, then joined NASA in 1994 as a flight surgeon. This is his third trip to the space station. [CLS] [SEP] — Kayla Barron, 34, a Navy lieutenant commander from Richland, Washington. She was among the first women to serve as submarine warfare officers. Added to the flight in May, she's No. 601 in space. [CLS] [SEP] During their six-month station stay, they will welcome two groups of tourists. A Russian film crew recently spent two weeks at the station, making a movie. [CLS] [SEP] The new crew will be joining three station residents — two Russians and NASA's Mark Vande Hei, who celebrated his 55th birthday on Wednesday. [CLS] [SEP] "NASA and @SpaceX are lighting a big candle in the sky for you tonight," NASA tweeted before the launch.
How Fast Fashion Is Destroying the Planet [CLS] [SEP] FASHIONOPOLIS [CLS] [SEP] The Price of Fast Fashion and the Future of Clothes [CLS] [SEP] By Dana Thomas [CLS] [SEP] There is that old saying, usually attributed to Yves Saint Laurent: “Fashion fades, style is eternal.” [CLS] [SEP] Literally speaking, that actually may no longer be true, especially when it comes to fast fashion. Fast-fashion brands may not design their clothing to last (and they don’t), but as artifacts of a particularly consumptive era, they might become an important part of the fossil record. [CLS] [SEP] More than 60 percent of fabric fibers are now synthetics, derived from fossil fuels, so if and when our clothing ends up in a landfill (about 85 percent of textile waste in the United States goes to landfills or is incinerated), it will not decay. [CLS] [SEP] Nor will the synthetic microfibers that end up in the sea, freshwater and elsewhere, including the deepest parts of the oceans and the highest glacier peaks. Future archaeologists may look at landfills taken over by nature and discover evidence of Zara. [CLS] [SEP] And it is Zara and other brands like it that have helped plant flags on the farthest reaches of the planet. In “Fashionopolis,” Dana Thomas, a veteran style writer, convincingly connects our fast-fashion wardrobes to global economic and climate patterns and crises, rooting the current state of the fashion biosphere as a whole — production methods, labor practices and environmental impacts — in the history of the garment industry. [CLS] [SEP] Her narrative is broken up into three manageable sections. The first focuses on today’s global fast-fashion and regular fashion industries and how they came to be so enormous, voracious, so seemingly uncontainable. It includes a fascinating account of how NAFTA made possible the international success of fast fashion. The second presents alternative, even opposite, approaches to making clothing that Thomas terms “slow fashion”: locally grown materials, often domestically manufactured or sourced on a relatively small scale, like the farmer and entrepreneur Sarah Bellos’s American-grown indigo. Lastly, she meets people who are trying to reform the system entirely, from the materials we use to how clothes are produced and the ways we shop. [CLS] [SEP] Throughout, Thomas reminds us that the textile industry has always been one of the darkest corners of the world economy. The defining product of the Industrial Revolution, textiles were crucial to the development of our globalized capitalist system, and its abuses today are built on a long history. Slave labor in the American South supplied factories in both England, where they were notorious for child labor and other horrors, and the United States, where factory fires took the lives of recent immigrants at the turn of the 20th century. Thomas reports that there are immigrant workers in Los Angeles today who are victims of wage theft and exploitation, not to mention the Bangladeshi, Chinese, Vietnamese and other laborers who face working conditions that are at best grim and at worst inhumane. Fashion is an industry that has depended on the toil of the powerless and the voiceless, and on keeping them that way. [CLS] [SEP] In one of the most powerful parts of the book, Thomas recounts the tragedy of the 2013 Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh, told through the harrowing experiences of two survivors. The explosion killed 1,100 people and injured another 2,500. And this was not a one-off: “Between 2006 and 2012, more than 500 Bangladeshi garment workers died in factory fires.” And, she notes, none of this news — the Rana Plaza catastrophe was widely covered — diminished Americans’ appetites for cheap clothing. In fact, Thomas writes, that same year Americans “spent $340 billion on fashion,” and “much of it was produced in Bangladesh, some of it by Rana Plaza workers in the days leading up to the collapse.” [CLS] [SEP] Not all of the book is this pessimistic: There is plenty of bubbliness and glamour for fashion lovers to get excited about. Thomas displays her skills as a culture and style reporter as she visits the visionaries who are attempting to remake the industry, if not from whole cloth, then maybe from lab-grown or recycled fibers of some kind. She conjures a pastoral idyll, for instance, in her depiction of the designer Natalie Chanin and her business, Alabama Chanin, a line of cotton clothing produced almost entirely in Florence, Ala., once the “Cotton T-Shirt Capital of the World.” In Thomas’s telling, these garments are both environmentally sustainable and humane, though with a revenue of just over $3 million last year, the 30-person company is no replacement for mass production when it comes to dressing seven billion people. [CLS] [SEP] Among the book’s delights are Thomas’s sketches of her individual subjects. I can’t get her description of a woman as “peaches-and-cream pretty” out of my head; I know exactly what she looks like. The author also has a gift for bringing luxury to life: She conjures Moda Operandi’s London showroom so vividly that I felt as though I’d moved in. [CLS] [SEP] In the last section, Thomas marvels at the ingenuity of those trying to “disrupt” fashion. She makes a strong argument for the importance of science applied to (what are often seen as) the frivolities of fashion, especially if we want to move away from the unartful excesses of mass production. [CLS] [SEP] Stella McCartney gets a disproportionate amount of attention here, and for good reason. McCartney has long been committed to sustainable practices, in her own business and others’. As the head designer at Chloé in the late 1990s, she refused to include leather or fur in her collections, which many executives then considered a death wish (some still do). She made it work, and has amplified those practices in her eponymous company, using, for instance, only “reclaimed” cashmere, refusing to use polyvinyl chloride or untraceable rayon. [CLS] [SEP] However, it is in contextualizing this single industry from a broader climate perspective that the book falls short. Some statistics are exaggerated: Livestock are not responsible for “at least half of all global greenhouse gas emissions,” but rather closer to 15 percent of them; nor is fashion production alone consuming water at a rate that, if maintained, “will surpass the world’s supply by 40 percent by 2030” (not even the world’s total water demand necessarily will). And much of the discussion of new materials and production methods raises further questions. What are the differences between organic, conventional and “Better Cotton”? (Organic cotton is periodically touted as a sustainable alternative, though it currently makes up only about 0.4 percent of the cotton market, making it nearly impossible for any company to rely on now or in the near future.) Another: Does the landfilling of non-synthetic clothing matter? Thomas doesn’t say, but in fact it does, because it contributes to global emission of methane, a potent heat-trapping gas. [CLS] [SEP] A lot of faith is placed here in the idea of “a circular — or closed-loop — system, in which products are continually recycled, reborn, reused. Nothing, ideally, should go in the trash.” But the practical considerations — cost, efficiency, resource limitations — are often left unaddressed. Ultimately, Thomas finds that renting clothing is the most sustainable model, and that feels like a more realistic solution than the futuristic materials she describes at length. In the end I was left wondering: If the fashion industry is this damaging, and none of these developments alone will fix the problem, shouldn’t governments be regulating production beyond enacting stricter pollution standards? [CLS] [SEP] That may be a question for another book; it is not the goal of “Fashionopolis” to provide all the answers. Thomas has succeeded in calling attention to the major problems in the $2.4-trillion-a-year industry, in a way that will engage not only the fashion set but also those interested in economics, human rights and climate policy. Her portraits of the figures who are transforming a field that hasn’t changed all that much in the last century or more sound at once like messages from the future and like nostalgic reveries of life in a smaller, simpler world. If we can combine them, this book suggests, the envisioned “fashionopolis” could transform from an urban nightmare into a shining city on a hill.
The privacy paradox: we claim we care about our data, so why don’t our actions match? [CLS] [SEP] Imagine how you’d feel if you discovered footage from your private home security camera had been broadcast over the internet. This is exactly what happened to several unsuspecting Australians last month, when the website Insecam streamed their personal lives online. [CLS] [SEP] According to an ABC report, Insecam broadcasts live streams of dozens of Australian businesses and homes at any given time. Some cameras can be accessed because owners don’t secure them. Some may be hacked into despite being “secured”. [CLS] [SEP] When asked if they care about their personal information being shared online, most people say they do. A 2017 survey found 69% of Australians were more concerned about their online privacy than in 2012. [CLS] [SEP] However, a much smaller percentage of people actually take the necessary actions to preserve their privacy. This is referred to as the “privacy paradox”, a concept first studied about two decades ago. [CLS] [SEP] To investigate this phenomenon further, we conducted a research project and found that, despite being concerned about privacy, participants were willing to sacrifice some of it in exchange for the convenience afforded by an internet-connected device. [CLS] [SEP] Unpacking the privacy paradox [CLS] [SEP] Any “smart” device connected to the internet is called an Internet of Things (IoT) device. These can be remotely monitored and controlled by the owners. [CLS] [SEP] The projected growth of IoT devices is staggering. By 2025, they’re expected to reach 75.44 billion – an increase of 146% from 2020. [CLS] [SEP] Are device owners genuinely concerned about their privacy? Recent worldwide anxiety about personal information shared through COVID-19 tracing apps seems to suggest so. [CLS] [SEP] But as the privacy paradox highlights, users expressing privacy concerns often fail to act in accordance with them. They freely divulge personal information in exchange for services and convenience. [CLS] [SEP] Explanations for the privacy paradox abound. Some suggest: [CLS] [SEP] 1. people find it difficult to associate a specific value to their privacy and therefore, the value of protecting it [CLS] [SEP] 2. people do not consider their personal information to be their own and thus might not appreciate the need to secure it [CLS] [SEP] 3. people completely lack awareness of their right to privacy or privacy issues and believe their desired goals (such as a personalised experience) outweigh the potential risks (such as big tech companies using their data for profiling). [CLS] [SEP] 4. The likely explanation for the privacy paradox is a mix of all these factors. [CLS] [SEP] What if we proved your device harvests data? [CLS] [SEP] To understand whether and how the privacy paradox applies to IoT devices, we conducted an experiment involving 46 Saudi Arabian participants. This is because in Saudi Arabia the use of IoT is exploding and the country does not have strong privacy regulations. [CLS] [SEP] We gave participants a smart plug that let them switch a table lamp on or off using an app on their smartphone. We then showed them the device’s privacy policy and measured participants’ privacy concerns and trust in the device. [CLS] [SEP] None of the participants read the privacy policy. They simply agreed to commence with the study. [CLS] [SEP] After two hours, we presented evidence of how much of their data the IoT-connected plug was harvesting, then remeasured their privacy concerns and trust. [CLS] [SEP] After the participants saw evidence of privacy violation, their privacy concerns increased and trust in the device decreased. However their behaviour did not align with their concern, as shown by the fact that: [CLS] [SEP] 1. 15 participants continued to use the device regardless [CLS] [SEP] 2. 13 continued to use it with their personal information removed [CLS] [SEP] only three opted to block all outbound traffic to unusual IP addresses. [CLS] [SEP] 3. The rest preferred “light-touch” responses, such as complaining on social media, complaining to the device’s manufacturer or falsifying their shared information. [CLS] [SEP] After one month, we measured participants’ attitudes a third time and discovered their privacy concerns and trust in the device had reverted to pre-experiment levels. [CLS] [SEP] How to prevent complacency [CLS] [SEP] Two decades since the first privacy paradox studies were conducted and despite a great deal of research, there is still a mismatch between people’s stated privacy concerns and their protective behaviours. How can we improve this? [CLS] [SEP] The first step is to simply be aware our judgement of IoT device risks and benefits may not be accurate. With that in mind, we should always take time to read the privacy policies of our devices. [CLS] [SEP] Besides informing us of the risks, reading privacy policies can help us stop and think before connecting a new device to the internet. Ask yourself: “is this really going to benefit me?” [CLS] [SEP] As citizen surveillance increases, it’s not wise to mindlessly scroll through privacy policies, tick a box and move on. [CLS] [SEP] Second, we should not assume our personal information is trivial and would not interest anyone. Time after time we have witnessed how our digital traces can be valuable to malicious individuals or large corporations. [CLS] [SEP] And finally, always change the default password on any new IoT device to a stronger one. Write down this password and secure it, perhaps with other physical valuables, so you don’t have to worry about forgetting it.
