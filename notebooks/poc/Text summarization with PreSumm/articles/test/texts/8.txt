AMC takes advantage of pandemic to expand presence in one notable city: Tinseltown

One of the casualties of the pandemic was the permanent closing of the ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific Theatres chains. ArcLight Cinemas had 11 locations, including a half-dozen in the Los Angeles area, as well as San Diego; two in Chicago; the Washington, D.C., area; and Boston. Pacific Theatres had six cinemas, all in the L.A. area.

The move flooded the Los Angeles market with more than 400,000 square feet of movie theater real estate — "an opportunity major chains such as Regal, AMC and Cinemark will likely capitalize on as the three make up nearly 70% of the regional cinema market," CBRE Group Inc. noted in a recent report.

Leawood-based AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE: AMC) became one of the first movers when it took over Pacific Theatres' flagship theaters, signing long-term leases for the 30,000-square-foot Grove and 43,412-square-foot Americana at Brand cinemas at the Los Angeles and Glendale, California, retail and entertainment complexes owned by luxury real estate developer Caruso. And Regal Cinemas signed a lease to take over the 87,000-square-foot ArcLight theater at the Sherman Oaks Galleria.

That leaves several movie houses and hundreds of thousands of square feet still up for grabs in Tinseltown.

"The silver screen hasn't lost its luster as some of the biggest players in the industry move to increase their regional footprint,” the CBRE report said.
