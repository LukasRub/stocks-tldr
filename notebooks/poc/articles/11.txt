AMD CEO Sees Chip Shortage Easing in 2022

The semiconductor shortage will begin to ease in 2022, Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su said at a session Monday at the Code Conference in Beverly Hills.

In an on-stage interview with Code Conference producer Kara Swisher and CNBC tech reporter Jon Fortt, the AMD (ticker: AMD) chief said that the semiconductor industry is investing aggressively in new capacity, with 20 new factories coming online this year and a similar number expected to come online in 2022. 

But Su also noted that the pandemic has “taken demand to a new level,” with every industry seeking more components. “Nobody expected this much demand,” she says.

Su dodged a question about whether AMD was threatened by a shift by some electronics companies to chips designed in house. 

Su also said the company continues to expect to close its pending acquisition of Xilinx (XLNX) by year end. She also said that consolidation in the chip industry is “inevitable.”

Asked about the use of AMD chips for crypto currency mining, Su said it is a small part of its business. She says the company is trying hard to get more products to gamers and the core business, rather than on crypto.
